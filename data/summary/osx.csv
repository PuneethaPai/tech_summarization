DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The hhaalltt and rreebboooott utilities flush the file system cache to disk, send
     all running processes a SIGTERM (and subsequently a SIGKILL) and, respec-
     tively, halt or restart the system.  The action is logged, including
     entering a shutdown record into the wtmp(5) file.

     When the system is halted with the halt command, the system is powered
     off.

     The options are as follows:

     --ll      The halt or reboot is _n_o_t recorded in the system log.  This
             option is intended for applications such as shutdown(8), that
             call rreebboooott or hhaalltt and log this themselves.

     --nn      The file system cache is not flushed.  This option should proba-
             bly not be used.

     --qq      The system is halted or restarted quickly and ungracefully, and
             only the flushing of the file system cache is performed (if the
             --nn option is not specified).  This option should probably not be
             used.

     --uu      The system is halted up until the point of removing system power,
             but waits before removing power for 5 minutes so that an external
             UPS (uninterruptible power supply) can forcibly remove power.
             This simulates a dirty shutdown to permit a later automatic power
             on. OS X uses this mode automatically with supported UPSs in
             emergency shutdowns.

     Normally, the shutdown(8) utility is used when the system needs to be
     halted or restarted, giving users advance warning of their impending doom
     and cleanly terminating specific programs.

     The SIGKILL will follow the SIGTERM by an intentionally indeterminate
     period of time.  Programs are expected to take only enough time to flush
     all dirty data and exit.  Developers are encouraged to file a bug with
     the OS vendor, should they encounter an issue with this functionality.

     _h_i_b_e_r_n_a_t_e_m_o_d_e supports values of 0, 3, or 25. Whether or not a hiberna-

     _a_u_t_o_p_o_w_e_r_o_f_f

     For example, on desktops that support _s_t_a_n_d_b_y a hibernation image will be
     written after the specified _s_t_a_n_d_b_y_d_e_l_a_y time. To disable hibernation
     images completely, ensure _h_i_b_e_r_n_a_t_e_m_o_d_e _s_t_a_n_d_b_y and _a_u_t_o_p_o_w_e_r_o_f_f are all
     set to 0.

     _h_i_b_e_r_n_a_t_e_m_o_d_e = 0 by default on desktops. The system will not back memory
     up to persistent storage. The system must wake from the contents of mem-
     ory; the system will lose context on power loss. This is, historically,
     plain old sleep.

     _h_i_b_e_r_n_a_t_e_m_o_d_e = 3 by default on portables. The system will store a copy
     of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during

     restore from hibernate image.

     _h_i_b_e_r_n_a_t_e_m_o_d_e = 25 is only settable via pmset. The system will store a
     copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will remove power to
     memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want ""hiberna-
     tion"" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you should
     use this setting.

     Please note that _h_i_b_e_r_n_a_t_e_f_i_l_e may only point to a file located on the
     root volume.

     _s_t_a_n_d_b_y causes kernel power management to automatically hibernate a
     machine after it has slept for a specified time period. This saves power
     while asleep. This setting defaults to _O_N for supported hardware. The
     setting _s_t_a_n_d_b_y will be visible in ppmmsseett --gg if the feature is supported
     on this machine.

     _s_t_a_n_d_b_y_d_e_l_a_y_h_i_g_h and _s_t_a_n_d_b_y_d_e_l_a_y_l_o_w specify the delay, in seconds,
     before writing the hibernation image to disk and powering off memory for
     Standby.  _s_t_a_n_d_b_y_d_e_l_a_y_h_i_g_h is used when the remaining battery capacity is

     _a_u_t_o_p_o_w_e_r_o_f_f is enabled by default on supported platforms as an implemen-
     tation of Lot 6 to the European Energy-related Products Directive. After
     sleeping for <autopoweroffdelay> seconds, the system will write a hiber-
     nation image and go into a lower power chipset sleep. Wakeups from this
     state will take longer than wakeups from regular sleep.

     _a_u_t_o_p_o_w_e_r_o_f_f_d_e_l_a_y specifies the delay, in seconds, before entering

     UPS-specific arguments are only valid following the --uu option. UPS set-
     tings also have an on/off value. Use a -1 argument instead of percent or
     minutes to turn any of these settings off. If multiple halt conditions
     are specified, the system will halt on the first condition that occurs in
     a low power situation.

     _h_a_l_t_l_e_v_e_l - when draining UPS battery, battery level at which to trigger

     pmset allows you to schedule system sleep, shutdown, wakeup and/or power
     on. ""schedule"" is for setting up one-time power events, and ""repeat"" is
     for setting up daily/weekly power on and power off events. Note that you
     may only have one pair of repeating events scheduled - a ""power on"" event
     and a ""power off"" event. For sleep cycling applications, pmset can sched-
     ule a ""relative"" wakeup or poweron to occur in seconds from the end of
     system sleep/shutdown, but this event cannot be cancelled and is inher-

     The ooppeenn command opens a file (or a directory or URL), just as if you had
     double-clicked the file's icon. If no application name is specified, the
     default application as determined via LaunchServices is used to open the
     specified files.

     If the file is in the form of a URL, the file will be opened as a URL.

     You can specify one or more file names (or pathnames), which are inter-
     preted relative to the shell or Terminal window's current working direc-
     tory. For example, the following command would open all Word files in the
     current working directory:

     open *.doc

     Opened applications inherit environment variables just as if you had
     launched the application directly through its full path.  This behavior
     was also present in Tiger.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa aapppplliiccaattiioonn
         Specifies the application to use for opening the file

     --bb bbuunnddllee__iinnddeennttiiffiieerr
         Specifies the bundle identifier for the application to use when open-
         ing the file

     --ee  Causes the file to be opened with /Applications/TextEdit

     --tt  Causes the file to be opened with the default text editor, as deter-
         mined via LaunchServices

     --ff  Reads input from standard input and opens the results in the default
         text editor.  End input by sending EOF character (type Control-D).
         Also useful for piping output to ooppeenn and having it open in the
         default text editor.

     --FF  Opens the application ""fresh,"" that is, without restoring windows.
         Saved persistent state is lost, except for Untitled documents.

     --WW  Causes ooppeenn to wait until the applications it opens (or that were
         already open) have exited.  Use with the --nn flag to allow ooppeenn to
         function as an appropriate app for the $$EEDDIITTOORR environment variable.

     --RR  Reveals the file(s) in the Finder instead of opening them.

     --nn  Open a new instance of the application(s) even if one is already run-
         ning.

     --gg  Do not bring the application to the foreground.

     --jj  Launches the app hidden.

     --hh  Searches header locations for a header whose name matches the given
         string and then opens it.  Pass a full header name (such as NSView.h)
         for increased performance.

     --ss  For -h, partial or full SDK name to use; if supplied, only SDKs whose
         names contain the argument value are searched. Otherwise the highest
         versioned SDK in each platform is used.

     ----aarrggss
         All remaining arguments are passed to the opened application in the
         argv parameter to main().  These arguments are not opened or inter-

     Finder.

     ""open -a /Applications/TextEdit.app '/Volumes/Macintosh HD/foo.txt'""
     opens the document in the application specified (in this case, TextEdit).

     ""open -b com.apple.TextEdit '/Volumes/Macintosh HD/foo.txt'"" opens the
     document in the application specified (in this case, TextEdit).

     ""open -e '/Volumes/Macintosh HD/foo.txt'"" opens the document in TextEdit.

     ""ls | open -f"" writes the output of the 'ls' command to a file in /tmp
     and opens the file in the default text editor (as determined by Launch-
     Services).

     ""open http://www.apple.com/"" opens the URL in the default browser.

     ""open 'file://localhost/Volumes/Macintosh HD/foo.txt'"" opens the document
     in the default application for its type (as determined by LaunchSer-
     vices).

     ""open 'file://localhost/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Applications/'"" opens that

     The ssttaatt utility displays information about the file pointed to by _f_i_l_e.
     Read, write or execute permissions of the named file are not required,
     but all directories listed in the path name leading to the file must be
     searchable.  If no argument is given, ssttaatt displays information about the
     file descriptor for standard input.

     When invoked as rreeaaddlliinnkk, only the target of the symbolic link is
     printed.  If the given argument is not a symbolic link, rreeaaddlliinnkk will
     print nothing and exit with an error.

     The information displayed is obtained by calling lstat(2) with the given
     argument and evaluating the returned structure.

     The options are as follows:

     --FF      As in ls(1), display a slash (`/') immediately after each path-
             name that is a directory, an asterisk (`*') after each that is
             executable, an at sign (`@') after each symbolic link, a percent
             sign (`%') after each whiteout, an equal sign (`=') after each
             socket, and a vertical bar (`|') after each that is a FIFO.  The
             use of --FF implies --ll.

     --ff _f_o_r_m_a_t
             Display information using the specified format.  See the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S
             section for a description of valid formats.

     --LL      Use stat(2) instead of lstat(2).  The information reported by
             ssttaatt will refer to the target of _f_i_l_e, if file is a symbolic
             link, and not to _f_i_l_e itself.

     --ll      Display output in llss --llTT format.

     --nn      Do not force a newline to appear at the end of each piece of out-
             put.

     --qq      Suppress failure messages if calls to stat(2) or lstat(2) fail.
             When run as rreeaaddlliinnkk, error messages are automatically sup-
             pressed.

     --rr      Display raw information.  That is, for all the fields in the _s_t_a_t
             structure, display the raw, numerical value (for example, times
             in seconds since the epoch, etc.).

     --ss      Display information in ``shell output'', suitable for initializ-
             ing variables.

     --tt _t_i_m_e_f_m_t
             Display timestamps using the specified format.  This format is
             passed directly to strftime(3).

     --xx      Display information in a more verbose way as known from some
             Linux distributions.

   FFoorrmmaattss
     Format strings are similar to printf(3) formats in that they start with
     %%, are then followed by a sequence of formatting characters, and end in a
     character that selects the field of the _s_t_r_u_c_t _s_t_a_t which is to be for-
     matted.  If the %% is immediately followed by one of nn, tt, %%, or @@, then a
     newline character, a tab character, a percent character, or the current
     file number is printed, otherwise the string is examined for the follow-
     ing:

     Any of the following optional flags:

     ##       Selects an alternate output form for octal and hexadecimal out-
             put.  Non-zero octal output will have a leading zero, and non-
             zero hexadecimal output will have ``0x'' prepended to it.

     ++       Asserts that a sign indicating whether a number is positive or
             negative should always be printed.  Non-negative numbers are not
             usually printed with a sign.

     --       Aligns string output to the left of the field, instead of to the
             right.

     00       Sets the fill character for left padding to the `0' character,
             instead of a space.

     space   Reserves a space at the front of non-negative signed output
             fields.  A `++' overrides a space if both are used.

     Then the following fields:

     _s_i_z_e    An optional decimal digit string specifying the minimum field
             width.

     _p_r_e_c    An optional precision composed of a decimal point `..' and a deci-
             mal digit string that indicates the maximum string length, the
             number of digits to appear after the decimal point in floating
             point output, or the minimum number of digits to appear in
             numeric output.

     _f_m_t     An optional output format specifier which is one of DD, OO, UU, XX,
             FF, or SS.  These represent signed decimal output, octal output,
             unsigned decimal output, hexadecimal output, floating point out-
             put, and string output, respectively.  Some output formats do not
             apply to all fields.  Floating point output only applies to
             _t_i_m_e_s_p_e_c fields (the aa, mm, and cc fields).

             The special output specifier SS may be used to indicate that the
             output, if applicable, should be in string format.  May be used
             in combination with:

             aammcc     Display date in strftime(3) format.

             ddrr      Display actual device name.

             gguu      Display group or user name.

             pp       Display the mode of _f_i_l_e as in llss --llTTdd.

             NN       Displays the name of _f_i_l_e.

             TT       Displays the type of _f_i_l_e.

             YY       Insert a `` -> '' into the output.  Note that the default
                     output format for YY is a string, but if specified explic-
                     itly, these four characters are prepended.

     _s_u_b     An optional sub field specifier (high, middle, low).  Only
             applies to the pp, dd, rr, and TT output formats.  It can be one of
             the following:

             HH       ``High'' -- specifies the major number for devices from rr
                     or dd, the ``user'' bits for permissions from the string
                     form of pp, the file ``type'' bits from the numeric forms
                     of pp, and the long output form of TT.

             LL       ``Low'' -- specifies the minor number for devices from rr
                     or dd, the ``other'' bits for permissions from the string
                     form of pp, the ``user'', ``group'', and ``other'' bits
                     from the numeric forms of pp, and the llss --FF style output
                     character for file type when used with TT (the use of LL
                     for this is optional).

             MM       ``Middle'' -- specifies the ``group'' bits for permis-
                     sions from the string output form of pp, or the ``suid'',
                     ``sgid'', and ``sticky'' bits for the numeric forms of pp.

     _d_a_t_u_m   A required field specifier, being one of the following:

             dd       Device upon which _f_i_l_e resides.

             ii       _f_i_l_e's inode number.

             pp       File type and permissions.

             ll       Number of hard links to _f_i_l_e.

             uu, gg    User ID and group ID of _f_i_l_e's owner.

             rr       Device number for character and block device special
                     files.

             aa, mm, cc, BB
                     The time _f_i_l_e was last accessed or modified, of when the
                     inode was last changed, or the birth time of the inode.

             zz       The size of _f_i_l_e in bytes.

             bb       Number of blocks allocated for _f_i_l_e.

             kk       Optimal file system I/O operation block size.

             ff       User defined flags for _f_i_l_e.

             vv       Inode generation number.

             The following four field specifiers are not drawn directly from
             the data in _s_t_r_u_c_t _s_t_a_t, but are:

             NN       The name of the file.

             TT       The file type, either as in llss --FF or in a more descrip-
                     tive form if the _s_u_b field specifier HH is given.

             YY       The target of a symbolic link.

             ZZ       Expands to ``major,minor'' from the _r_d_e_v field for char-
                     acter or block special devices and gives size output for
                     all others.

     Only the %% and the field specifier are required.  Most field specifiers
     default to UU as an output form, with the exception of pp which defaults to
     OO, aa, mm, and cc which default to DD, and YY, TT, and NN which default to SS.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
     The ssttaatt and rreeaaddlliinnkk utilities exit 0 on success, and >0 if an error
     occurs.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     Given a symbolic link _f_o_o that points from _/_t_m_p_/_f_o_o to _/, you would use
     ssttaatt as follows:

           > stat -F /tmp/foo
           lrwxrwxrwx 1 jschauma cs 1 Apr 24 16:37:28 2002 /tmp/foo@ -> /

           > stat -LF /tmp/foo
           drwxr-xr-x 16 root wheel 512 Apr 19 10:57:54 2002 /tmp/foo/

     To initialize some shell variables, you could use the --ss flag as follows:

           > csh
           % eval set `stat -s .cshrc`
           % echo $st_size $st_mtimespec
           1148 1015432481

           > sh
           $ eval $(stat -s .profile)
           $ echo $st_size $st_mtimespec
           1148 1015432481

     In order to get a list of the kind of files including files pointed to if
     the file is a symbolic link, you could use the following format:

           $ stat -f ""%N: %HT%SY"" /tmp/*
           /tmp/bar: Symbolic Link -> /tmp/foo
           /tmp/output25568: Regular File
           /tmp/blah: Directory
           /tmp/foo: Symbolic Link -> /

     In order to get a list of the devices, their types and the major and
     minor device numbers, formatted with tabs and linebreaks, you could use
     the following format:

           stat -f ""Name: %N%n%tType: %HT%n%tMajor: %Hr%n%tMinor: %Lr%n%n"" /dev/*
           [...]
           Name: /dev/wt8
                   Type: Block Device
                   Major: 3
                   Minor: 8

           Name: /dev/zero
                   Type: Character Device
                   Major: 2
                   Minor: 12

     In order to determine the permissions set on a file separately, you could
     use the following format:

           > stat -f ""%Sp -> owner=%SHp group=%SMp other=%SLp"" .
           drwxr-xr-x -> owner=rwx group=r-x other=r-x

     In order to determine the three files that have been modified most
     recently, you could use the following format:

           > stat -f ""%m%t%Sm %N"" /tmp/* | sort -rn | head -3 | cut -f2-
           Apr 25 11:47:00 2002 /tmp/blah
           Apr 25 10:36:34 2002 /tmp/bar
           Apr 24 16:47:35 2002 /tmp/foo

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       As  of  Xcode  8.0  the default _n_m(1) tool is _l_l_v_m_-_n_m(1).  They for the
       most part have the same options except for --ff and --ss which the  differ-
       ences are noted below.  More help on options for _l_l_v_m_-_n_m(1) is provided
       when running it with the ----hheellpp option.

       _N_m displays the name list (symbol table of nlist  structures)  of  each
       object  _f_i_l_e  in  the  argument list.  In some cases, as with an object
       that has had _s_t_r_i_p(1) with its --TT option used on the object,  that  can
       be different than the dyld information.  For that information use _d_y_l_d_-
       _i_n_f_o(1).

       If an argument is an archive, a listing for each object file in the ar-
       chive  will be produced.  _F_i_l_e can be of the form libx.a(x.o), in which
       case only symbols from that member of the object file are listed.  (The
       parentheses  have  to  be  quoted  to get by the shell.)  If no _f_i_l_e is
       given, the symbols in _a_._o_u_t are listed.

       Each symbol name is  preceded  by  its  value  (blanks  if  undefined).
       Unless the --mm option is specified, this value is followed by one of the
       following characters, representing the symbol type:  UU  (undefined),  AA
       (absolute),  TT  (text  section symbol), DD (data section symbol), BB (bss
       section symbol), CC  (common  symbol),  --  (for  debugger  symbol  table
       entries; see --aa below), SS (symbol in a section other than those above),
       or II (indirect symbol).  If the symbol  is  local  (non-external),  the
       symbol's  type  is  instead  represented by the corresponding lowercase
       letter.  A lower case uu in a dynamic shared library indicates  a  unde-
       fined  reference  to  a  private external in another module in the same
       library.

       If  the  symbol  is  a  Objective  C  method,  the   symbol   name   is
       ++--[[_C_l_a_s_s___n_a_m_e_(_c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y___n_a_m_e_)  _m_e_t_h_o_d_:_n_a_m_e_:]],  where  `+'  is  for class
       methods, `-' is for instance methods, and  _(_c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y___n_a_m_e_)  is  present
       only when the method is in a category.

       The output is sorted alphabetically by default.

       Options are:

       --aa     Display  all  symbol table entries, including those inserted for
              use by debuggers.

       --gg     Display only global (external) symbols.

       --nn     Sort numerically rather than alphabetically.

       --oo     Prepend file or archive element name to each output line, rather
              than only once.

       --pp     Don't sort; display in symbol-table order.

       --rr     Sort in reverse order.

       --uu     Display only undefined symbols.

       --UU     Don't display undefined symbols.

       --mm     Display  the  N_SECT  type  symbols  (Mach-O  symbols)  as (_s_e_g_-
              _m_e_n_t___n_a_m_e_, _s_e_c_t_i_o_n___n_a_m_e) followed by  either  _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l  or  _n_o_n_-
              _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l  and then the symbol name.  Undefined, common, absolute
              and indirect symbols get  displayed  as  _(_u_n_d_e_f_i_n_e_d_),  _(_c_o_m_m_o_n_),
              _(_a_b_s_o_l_u_t_e_), and _(_i_n_d_i_r_e_c_t_), respectively.

       --xx     Display  the  symbol  table entry's fields in hexadecimal, along
              with the name as a string.

       --jj     Just display the symbol names (no value or type).

       --ss _s_e_g_n_a_m_e _s_e_c_t_n_a_m_e
              List only those symbols in the section _(_s_e_g_n_a_m_e_,_s_e_c_t_n_a_m_e_)_.   For
              _l_l_v_m_-_n_m(1)  this  option  must  be last on the command line, and
              after the files.

       --ll     List a pseudo symbol _._s_e_c_t_i_o_n___s_t_a_r_t if  no  symbol  has  as  its
              value  the  starting address of the section.  (This is used with
              the --ss option above.)

       --aarrcchh _a_r_c_h___t_y_p_e
              Specifies the architecture, _a_r_c_h___t_y_p_e_, of the file for _n_m(1)  to
              operate  on  when  the file is a universal file (see _a_r_c_h(3) for
              the currently known _a_r_c_h___t_y_p_es).  The _a_r_c_h___t_y_p_e can be ""all""  to
              operate  on  all  architectures  in the file.  The default is to
              display the symbols from only the host architecture, if the file
              contains  it;  otherwise,  symbols  for all architectures in the
              file are displayed.

       --ff  ffoorrmmaatt
              For _l_l_v_m_-_n_m(1) this specifies the output format.   Where  format
              can be bsd, sysv, posix or darwin.

       --ff     For  _n_m_-_c_l_a_s_s_i_c(1)  this  displays the symbol table of a dynamic
              library flat (as one file not separate modules).  This is  obso-
              lete and not supported with _l_l_v_m_-_n_m_(_1_)_.

       --AA     Write the pathname or library name of an object on each line.

       --PP     Write information in a portable output format.

       --tt _f_o_r_m_a_t
              For the --PP output, write the numeric value in the specified for-
              mat. The format shall be dependent on the single character  used
              as the format option-argument:

       _d      The value shall be written in decimal (default).

       _o      The value shall be written in octal.

       _x      The value shall be written in hexadecimal.

       --LL     Display  the  symbols in the bitcode files in the (__LLVM,__bun-
              dle) section if present instead of the  object's  symbol  table.
              This  is the default if the object has no symbol table and there
              is an (__LLVM,__bundle) section.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     DDeeffaauullttss allows users to read, write, and delete Mac OS X user defaults
     from a command-line shell. Mac OS X applications and other programs use
     the defaults system to record user preferences and other information that
     must be maintained when the applications aren't running (such as default
     font for new documents, or the position of an Info panel). Much of this
     information is accessible through an application's Preferences panel, but
     some of it isn't, such as the position of the Info panel. You can access
     this information with ddeeffaauullttss

     NNoottee:: Since applications do access the defaults system while they're run-
     ning, you shouldn't modify the defaults of a running application. If you
     change a default in a domain that belongs to a running application, the
     application won't see the change and might even overwrite the default.

     User defaults belong to _d_o_m_a_i_n_s, which typically correspond to individual
     applications. Each domain has a dictionary of keys and values represent-
     ing its defaults; for example, ""Default Font"" = ""Helvetica"". Keys are
     always strings, but values can be complex data structures comprising
     arrays, dictionaries, strings, and binary data. These data structures are
     stored as XML Property Lists.

     Though all applications, system services, and other programs have their
     own domains, they also share a domain named NNSSGGlloobbaallDDoommaaiinn.  If a default
     isn't specified in the application's domain, but is specified in
     NNSSGGlloobbaallDDoommaaiinn, then the application uses the value in that domain.

     The commands are as follows:

     rreeaadd         Prints all of the user's defaults, for every domain, to
                  standard output.

     rreeaadd _d_o_m_a_i_n  Prints all of the user's defaults for _d_o_m_a_i_n to standard
                  output.

     rreeaadd _d_o_m_a_i_n _k_e_y
                  Prints the value for the default of _d_o_m_a_i_n identified by
                  _k_e_y.

     rreeaadd--ttyyppee _d_o_m_a_i_n _k_e_y
                  Prints the plist type for the given _d_o_m_a_i_n identified by
                  _k_e_y.

     wwrriittee _d_o_m_a_i_n _k_e_y _'_v_a_l_u_e_'
                  Writes _v_a_l_u_e as the value for _k_e_y in _d_o_m_a_i_n.  _v_a_l_u_e must be
                  a property list, and must be enclosed in single quotes.  For
                  example:

                        defaults write com.companyname.appname ""Default Color"" '(255, 0, 0)'

                  sets the value for Default Color to an array containing the
                  strings 255, 0, 0 (the red, green, and blue components).
                  Note that the key is enclosed in quotation marks because it
                  contains a space.

     wwrriittee _d_o_m_a_i_n _'_p_l_i_s_t_'
                  Overwrites the defaults information in _d_o_m_a_i_n with that
                  given as _p_l_i_s_t.  _p_l_i_s_t must be a property list representa-
                  tion of a dictionary, and must be enclosed in single quotes.
                  For example:

                        defaults write com.companyname.appname '{ ""Default Color"" = (255, 0, 0);
                                                        ""Default Font"" = Helvetica; }';

                  erases any previous defaults for com.companyname.appname and
                  writes the values for the two names into the defaults sys-
                  tem.

     ddeelleettee _d_o_m_a_i_n
                  Removes all default information for _d_o_m_a_i_n.

     ddeelleettee _d_o_m_a_i_n _k_e_y
                  Removes the default named _k_e_y from _d_o_m_a_i_n.

     ddoommaaiinnss      Prints the names of all domains in the user's defaults sys-
                  tem.

     ffiinndd _w_o_r_d    Searches for _w_o_r_d in the domain names, keys, and values of
                  the user's defaults, and prints out a list of matches.

     hheellpp         Prints a list of possible command formats.

     _d_o_m_a_i_n    If no flag is specified, _d_o_m_a_i_n is a domain name of the form
               com.companyname.appname.  Example:

                     defaults read com.apple.TextEdit

     --aapppp _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n
               The name of an application may be provided instead of a domain
               using the --aapppp flag. Example:

                     defaults read -app TextEdit

     _f_i_l_e_p_a_t_h  Domains may also be specified as a path to an arbitrary plist
               file, with or without the '.plist' extension. For example:

                     defaults read ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TextEdit.plist

               normally gives the same result as the two previous examples.
               In the following example:

                     defaults write ~/Desktop/TestFile foo bar

               will write the key 'foo' with the value 'bar' into the plist
               file 'TestFile.plist' that is on the user's desktop. If the
               file does not exist, it will be created. If it does exist, the
               key-value pair will be added, overwriting the value of 'foo' if
               it already existed.

               WARNING: The defaults command will be changed in an upcoming
               major release to only operate on preferences domains. General
               plist manipulation utilities will be folded into a different
               command-line program.

                 The specified array overwrites the value of the key if the
                 key was present at the time of the write. If the key was not
                 present, it is created with the new value.

     --aarrrraayy--aadddd  Allows the user to add new elements to the end of an array
                 for a key which has an array as its value. Usage is the same
                 as -array above. If the key was not present, it is created
                 with the specified array as its value.

     --ddiicctt       Allows the user to add a dictionary to the defaults database

                 The specified dictionary overwrites the value of the key if
                 the key was present at the time of the write. If the key was
                 not present, it is created with the new value.

     --ddiicctt--aadddd   Allows the user to add new key/value pairs to a dictionary
                 for a key which has a dictionary as its value. Usage is the

     tteexxttuuttiill can be used to manipulate text files of various formats, using
     the mechanisms provided by the Cocoa text system.

     The first argument indicates the operation to perform, one of:

     --hheellpp         Show the usage information for the command and exit.  This
                   is the default command option if none is specified.

                   result out as a single file in the indicated format.

                   _f_m_t is one of:  ttxxtt, hhttmmll, rrttff, rrttffdd, ddoocc, ddooccxx, wwoorrddmmll,

     There are some additional options for general use:

     --eexxtteennssiioonn _e_x_t  Specify an extension to be used for output files (by
                     default, the extension will be determined from the for-

                     output files (by default, the output encoding will be
                     UTF-8).  NSStringEncoding refers to one of the numeric
                     values recognized by NSString.  IANA_name refers to an
                     IANA character set name as understood by CFString.  The
                     operation will fail if the file cannot be converted to

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The xxaattttrr command can be used to display, modify or remove the extended
     attributes of one or more files, including directories and symbolic
     links.  Extended attributes are arbitrary metadata stored with a file,
     but separate from the filesystem attributes (such as modification time or
     file size).  The metadata is often a null-terminated UTF-8 string, but
     can also be arbitrary binary data.

     One or more files may be specified on the command line.  For the first
     two forms of the command, when there are more than one file, the file
     name is displayed along with the actual results.  When only one file is
     specified, the display of the file name is usually suppressed (unless the
     --vv option described below, is also specified).

     In the first form of the command (without any other mode option speci-
     fied), the names of all extended attributes are listed.  Attribute names
     can also be displayed using ``ls -l@''.

     In the second form, using the --pp option (``print''), the value associated
     with the given attribute name is displayed.  Attribute values are usually
     displayed as strings.  However, if nils are detected in the data, the
     value is displayed in a hexadecimal representation.

     The third form, with the --ww option (``write''), causes the given
     attribute name to be assigned the given value.

     The fourth form, with the --dd option (``delete''), causes the given
     attribute name (and associated value), to be removed.

     In the fifth form, with the --cc option (``clear''), causes all attributes
     (including their associated values), to be removed.

     Finally, the last form, with either the --hh or ----hheellpp option, displays a
     short help message and exits immediately.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     --ll  By default, the first two command forms either displays just the
         attribute names or values, respectively.  The --ll option causes both
         the attribute names and corresponding values to be displayed.  For
         hexadecimal display of values, the output is preceeded with the hexa-
         decimal offset values and followed by ASCII display, enclosed by
         ``|''.

     --rr  If a file argument is a directory, act as if the entire contents of
         the directory recursively were also specified (so that every file in
         the directory tree is acted upon).

     --ss  If a file argument is a symbolic link, act on the symbolic link
         itself, rather than the file that the symbolic link points at.

     --vv  Force the the file name to be displayed, even for a single file.

     --xx  Force the attribute value to be displayed in the hexadecimal repre-
         sentation.

         The --ww option normally assumes the input attribute value is a string.
         Specifying the --xx option causes xxaattttrr to expect the input in hexadec-
         imal (whitespace is ignored).  The xxd(1) command can be used to cre-
         ate hexadecimal representations from exising binary data, to pass to
         xxaattttrr.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
     The xxaattttrr command exits with zero status on success.  On error, non-zero
     is returned, and an error message is printed to the standard error.  For
     system call errors, both the error code and error string are printed (see
     getxattr(2), listxattr(2), removexattr(2) and setxattr(2) for a complete
     list of possible error codes).

     Some attribute data may have a fixed length that is enforced by the sys-
     tem.  For example,

           % xattr -w com.apple.FinderInfo 0 foo
           xattr: [Errno 34] Result too large: 'foo'

     The com.apple.FinderInfo attribute must be 32 bytes in length.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     This example copies the com.apple.FinderInfo attribute from the /usr
     directory to the MyDir directory:

           % xattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo /usr
           00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

             ""`xattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo /usr`"" MyDir
           % xattr -l MyDir
           com.apple.FinderInfo:

       The program //uussrr//bbiinn//aass is actually a driver that  executes  assemblers

              assembler for an architecture family.  If the  specified  target
              architecture is a machine-specific implementation, the assembler
              for   that    architecture    family    is    executed    (e.g.,
              //uussrr//lliibbeexxeecc//ggcccc//ddaarrwwiinn//ppppcc//aass  for --aarrcchh ppppcc660044ee).  See _a_r_c_h(3)

              to distinguish which architecture the error messages  refer  to.
              When  the _c_c(1) driver program is run with multiple --aarrcchh flags,

              By default, the assembler will produce the CPU subtype  ALL  for
              the  object file it is assembling if it finds no implementation-
              specific instructions.  Also  by  default,  the  assembler  will
              allow  implementation-specific instructions and will combine the
              CPU subtype for those specific implementations.   The  combining
              of  specific  implementations is architecture-dependent; if some
              combination of instructions is not allowed, an error  is  gener-
              ated.    With   the  optional  --ffoorrccee__ccppuussuubbttyyppee__AALLLL  flag,  all
              instructions are allowed and the object file's CPU subtype  will
              be  the  ALL subtype.  If the target architecture specified is a
              machine-specific  implementation  (e.g.,  --aarrcchh  ppppcc660033,   --aarrcchh
              ii448866),  the  assembler will flag as errors instructions that are
              not supported on that  architecture,  and  it  will  produce  an
              object  file  with the CPU subtype for that specific implementa-
              tion (even if no implementation-specific instructions are used).
              The  --ffoorrccee__ccppuussuubbttyyppee__AALLLL  flag  is the default for all x86 and
              x86_64 architectures.

       --ddyynnaammiicc
              Enables dynamic linking features.  This is the default.

       --ssttaattiicc
              Causes the assembler to treat  as  an  error  any  features  for
              dynamic linking.  Also causes the .text directive to not include
              the pure_instructions section attribute.

       ----     Use ssttddiinn for the assembly source input.

       --nn     Instructs the assembler not to assume  that  the  assembly  file
              starts  with  a ..tteexxtt directive.  Use this option when an output
              file is not to contain a (__TEXT,__text) section or this section
              is not to be first one in the output file.

       --ff     Fast;  no  need  for  the assembler preprocessor (``app'').  The
              assembler preprocessor can also be turned off  by  starting  the
              assembly  file  with  ""#NO_APP\n"".   This is intended for use by
              compilers which produce assembly code in a strict ""clean"" format
              that  specifies  exactly where whitespace can go.  The assembler
              preprocessor needs to be  run  on  hand-written  assembly  files
              and/or  files  that have been preprocessed by the C preprocessor
              ccpppp..  This is typically needed when assembler files  are  assem-
              bled  through  the use of the _c_c(1) command, which automatically
              runs the C preprocessor on assembly source files.  The assembler
              preprocessor strips out excess spaces, turns single-quoted char-
              acters into a decimal constants, and turns # <number> <filename>
              <level>  into  .line <number>;.file <filename>  pairs.  When the
              assembler preprocessor has been turned off by a  ""#NO_APP\n""  at
              the start of a file, it can be turned back on and off again with
              pairs of ""#APP\n"" and ""#NO_APP\n"" at the  beginnings  of  lines.
              This  is  used  by the compiler to wrap assembly statements pro-
              duced from aassmm(()) statements.

       --gg     Produce debugging information for the symbolic  debugger  _g_d_b(1)
              so  that  the assembly source can be debugged symbolically.  The
              debugger depends on correct use of the C preprocessor's #include
              directive  or  the  assembler's .include directive:  Any include
              file that produces instructions in the  (__TEXT,__text)  section
              must be included while a .text directive is in effect.  In other
              words, there must be a .text directive before the  include,  and
              the  .text  directive  must still be in effect at the end of the
              include file.  Otherwise, the debugger will get confused when in
              that assembly file.

       --vv     Display  the version of the assembler (both the Mac OS X version
              and the GNU version it is based on).

       --VV     Print the path and the command line of the assembler the  assem-
              bler driver is using.

       --II_d_i_r  Add  the  directory _d_i_r to the list of directories to search for
              files included with the .include directive.  The  default  place
              to search is the current directory.

       --WW     Suppress warnings.

       --LL     Save  non-global  defined  labels  beginning  with an 'L'; these
              labels are normally discarded to save  space  in  the  resultant
              symbol table.  The compiler generates such temporary labels.

       --qq     Use  the  _c_l_a_n_g(1) integrated assembler instead of the GNU based
              system assembler.  This is the  default  for  the  x86  and  arm
              architectures.

       --QQ     Use the GNU based system assembler.

              Treat  a  single trailing '+' or '-' after a conditional PowerPC
              branch instruction as a static branch prediction that  sets  the
              Y-bit  in the opcode.  Pairs of trailing ""++"" or ""--"" always set
              the AT-bits. This is the default for Mac OS X.

              Treat a single trailing '+' or '-' after a  conditional  PowerPC
              branch  instruction  as a static branch prediction that sets the
              AT-bits in the opcode. Pairs of trailing ""++"" or ""--"" always set
              the  AT-bits  but  with  this option a warning is issued if this
              syntax is used.  With this flag the assembler behaves  like  the
              IBM tools.

       --nnoo__ppppcc660011
              Treat any PowerPC 601 instructions as an error.

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The cchhffllaaggss utility modifies the file flags of the listed files as speci-
     fied by the _f_l_a_g_s operand.

     The options are as follows:

     --ff      Do not display a diagnostic message if cchhffllaaggss could not modify
             the flags for _f_i_l_e, nor modify the exit status to reflect such
             failures.

     --HH      If the --RR option is specified, symbolic links on the command line
             are followed.  (Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal
             are not followed.)

     --hh      If the _f_i_l_e is a symbolic link, change the file flags of the link
             itself rather than the file to which it points.

     --LL      If the --RR option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.

     --PP      If the --RR option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
             This is the default.

     --RR      Change the file flags for the file hierarchies rooted in the
             files instead of just the files themselves.

     --vv      Cause cchhffllaaggss to be verbose, showing filenames as the flags are
             modified.  If the --vv option is specified more than once, the old
             and new flags of the file will also be printed, in octal nota-
             tion.

     The flags are specified as an octal number or a comma separated list of
     keywords.  The following keywords are currently defined:

           aarrcchh, aarrcchhiivveedd
                   set the archived flag (super-user only)

           ooppaaqquuee  set the opaque flag (owner or super-user only).  [Directory
                   is opaque when viewed through a union mount]

           nnoodduummpp  set the nodump flag (owner or super-user only)

           ssaappppnndd, ssaappppeenndd
                   set the system append-only flag (super-user only)

           sscchhgg, sscchhaannggee, ssiimmmmuuttaabbllee
                   set the system immutable flag (super-user only)

           uuaappppnndd, uuaappppeenndd
                   set the user append-only flag (owner or super-user only)

           uucchhgg, uucchhaannggee, uuiimmmmuuttaabbllee
                   set the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)

           hhiiddddeenn  set the hidden flag [Hide item from GUI]

     Putting the letters ``_n_o'' before or removing the letters ``_n_o'' from a
     keyword causes the flag to be cleared.  For example:

           _n_o_u_c_h_g  clear the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)
           _d_u_m_p    clear the nodump flag (owner or super-user only)

     Unless the --HH or --LL options are given, cchhffllaaggss on a symbolic link always
     succeeds and has no effect.  The --HH, --LL and --PP options are ignored unless
     the --RR option is specified.  In addition, these options override each
     other and the command's actions are determined by the last one specified.

     You can use ""ls -lO"" to see the flags of existing files.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The sspplliitt utility reads the given _f_i_l_e and breaks it up into files of
     1000 lines each.  If _f_i_l_e is a single dash (`--') or absent, sspplliitt reads
     from the standard input.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa _s_u_f_f_i_x___l_e_n_g_t_h
             Use _s_u_f_f_i_x___l_e_n_g_t_h letters to form the suffix of the file name.

     --bb _b_y_t_e___c_o_u_n_t_[_k_|_m_]
             Create smaller files _b_y_t_e___c_o_u_n_t bytes in length.  If ``k'' is
             appended to the number, the file is split into _b_y_t_e___c_o_u_n_t kilo-
             byte pieces.  If ``m'' is appended to the number, the file is
             split into _b_y_t_e___c_o_u_n_t megabyte pieces.

     --ll _l_i_n_e___c_o_u_n_t
             Create smaller files _n lines in length.

     --pp _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             The file is split whenever an input line matches _p_a_t_t_e_r_n, which
             is interpreted as an extended regular expression.  The matching
             line will be the first line of the next output file.  This option
             is incompatible with the --bb and --ll options.

     If additional arguments are specified, the first is used as the name of
     the input file which is to be split.  If a second additional argument is
     specified, it is used as a prefix for the names of the files into which
     the file is split.  In this case, each file into which the file is split
     is named by the prefix followed by a lexically ordered suffix using
     _s_u_f_f_i_x___l_e_n_g_t_h characters in the range ``a-z''.  If --aa is not specified,
     two letters are used as the suffix.

     If the _n_a_m_e argument is not specified, the file is split into lexically
     ordered files named with the prefix ``x'' and with suffixes as above.

     layouts, and formats of disks. This includes hard disks, solid state

                If no argument is given, then all whole disks and their parti-
                tions are listed.

                You can limit the number of disks shown by specifying filter-
                ing arguments such as iinntteerrnnaall above, and/or a _d_e_v_i_c_e disk.
                When limiting by a disk, you can specify either a whole disk,
                e.g. disk0, or any of its slices, e.g. disk0s3, but filtering
                is only done at the whole disk level (disk0s3 is a synonym for
                disk0 in this case).

                If --pplliisstt is specified, then a property list will be emitted
                instead of the normal user-readable output.

                A script could interpret the results of ddiisskkuuttiill lliisstt --pplliisstt
                and use ddiisskkuuttiill iinnffoo --pplliisstt as well as ddiisskkuuttiill

                The top-to-bottom appearance of all whole disks is sorted in
                numerical order by unit (whole disk) number.  However, within
                each whole disk's ""sublist"" of partitions, the ordering indi-
                cates actual on-disk location. The first disk item listed rep-
                resents the partition which is located most near the beginning
                of its encompassing whole disk, and so on.

                When viewed this way, the slice (partition) parts of the BSD
                disk identifiers may, in certain circumstances, not appear in
                numerical order.  This is normal and is likely the result of a
                recent partition map editing operation in which volumes were
                kept mounted.

                Note that both human-readable and plist output are sorted as
                described above.

                Continuously display system-wide disk manipulation activity as
                reported by the Disk Arbitration framework until interrupted
                with a signal (e.g. by typing Control-C).

                This can be useful to watch system-wide activity of disks com-
                ing on-line or being ejected, volumes on disks being mounted
                or unmounted, volumes being renamed, etc.  However, this out-
                put must never be parsed; programs should become Disk Arbitra-
                tion clients instead.

                For debugging information, such as the monitoring of applica-
                tions dissenting (attempting to deny) activities for disks for
                which they have registered an interest, you must use the log-
                ging features of the ddiisskkaarrbbiittrraattiioonndd daemon. Programs needing
                this information must become Disk Arbitration clients.

                whether or not the volume is currently mounted (the volume is
                temporarily mounted if necessary).  If the ffoorrccee option is

                this case, the volume must not be mounted.  Ownership of the

                partition to serve as a journal for the volume _d_e_v_i_c_e_. For
                best results, _j_o_u_r_n_a_l_D_e_v_i_c_e should be a partition on a differ-
                ent whole-disk than the volume itself.

                The journal for _d_e_v_i_c_e will be moved externally onto the newly
                created Apple_Journal partition.

                Since the _j_o_u_r_n_a_l_D_e_v_i_c_e you specify will invariably be larger
                than 512MB, a new HFS+ partition will be created following the
                Apple_Journal partition to fill the remaining space.

                Moving the journal works whether or not the volume is mounted,
                provided journaling is enabled on that volume. No errors are
                currently supported to flag attempts to move journals on vol-
                umes that do not have journaling enabled.  If you have multi-
                ple volumes for which you want external journals, each must
                have its own external Apple_Journal partition.  Ownership of
                the affected disks is required.

     mmoovveeJJoouurrnnaall iinntteerrnnaall _d_e_v_i_c_e
                Move the journal for _d_e_v_i_c_e back locally (onto that same
                device).  Ownership of the affected disk is required.

                Enable ownership of a volume.  The on-root-disk Volume Data-
                base at /var/db/volinfo.database is manipulated such that the
                User and Group ID settings of files, directories, and links
                (file system objects, or ""FSOs"") on the target volume are
                taken into account.

                This setting for a particular volume is persistent across
                ejects and injects of that volume as seen by the current OS,
                even across reboots of that OS, because of the entries in this
                OS's Volume Database.  Note thus that the setting is not kept
                on the target disk, nor is it in-memory.

                For some locations of devices (e.g. internal hard disks), con-
                sideration of ownership settings on FSOs is the default.  For
                others (e.g. plug-in USB disks), it is not.

                When ownership is disabled, Owner and Group ID settings on
                FSOs appear to the user and programs as the current user and
                group instead of their actual on-disk settings, in order to
                make it easy to use a plug-in disk of which the user has phys-
                ical possession.

                When ownership is enabled, the Owner and Group ID settings
                that exist on the disk are taken into account for determining
                access, and exact settings are written to the disk as FSOs are
                created.  A common reason for having to enable ownership is
                when a disk is to contain FSOs whose User and Group ID set-
                tings, and thus permissions behavior overall, is critically
                important, such as when the plug-in disk contains system files
                to be changed or added to.

                Erase a whole disk, writing random data to the media.  _T_i_m_e_s
                is the optional (defaults to 1) number of times to write ran-
                dom information.  The device can be a whole-disk or a parti-
                tion.  In either case, in order to be useful again, randomized
                whole-disks will need to be (re)partitioned, or randomized
                partitions will need to be (re)formatted with a file system,
                e.g. by using the ppaarrttiittiioonnDDiisskk,, eerraasseeDDiisskk,, or eerraasseeVVoolluummee

                if you need to erase only free space not in use for files, use
                the sseeccuurreeEErraassee verb.  Ownership of the affected disk is
                required.

                Erase, using a ""secure"" (but see the NOTE below) method,
                either a whole-disk (including all of its partitions if parti-
                tioned), or, only the free space (not in use for files) on a
                currently-mounted volume.  Secure erasing makes it harder to
                recover data using ""file recovery"" software.

                Erasing a whole-disk will leave it useless until it is parti-
                tioned again.  Erasing freespace on a volume will leave your
                files intact, indeed, from an end-user perspective, it will
                appear unchanged, with the exception that it will have
                attempted to make it impossible to recover deleted files.

                If you need to erase all contents of a partition but not its
                hosting whole-disk, use the zzeerrooDDiisskk or rraannddoommDDiisskk verbs.
                Ownership of the affected disk is required.

                _L_e_v_e_l should be one of the following:

                      ++oo   0 - Single-pass zero-fill erase.

                      ++oo   1 - Single-pass random-fill erase.

                      ++oo   2 - US DoD 7-pass secure erase.

                      ++oo   3 - Gutmann algorithm 35-pass secure erase.

                      ++oo   4 - US DoE algorithm 3-pass secure erase.

                NOTE: This kind of secure erase is no longer considered safe.
                Modern devices have wear-leveling, block-sparing, and possi-
                bly-persistent cache hardware, which cannot be completely
                erased by these commands. The modern solution for quickly and
                securely erasing your data is encryption. Strongly-encrypted
                data can be instantly ""erased"" by destroying (or losing) the
                key (password), because this renders your data irretrievable
                in practical terms.  Consider using APFS encryption (File-
                Vault).

                (re)Partition a disk, removing all volumes.  All volumes on
                this disk will be destroyed.  The _d_e_v_i_c_e parameter specifies
                which whole disk is to be partitioned.  The optional
                _n_u_m_b_e_r_O_f_P_a_r_t_i_t_i_o_n_s parameter specifies the number of parti-

                triplets (see below) is expected to match; else, the number of
                triplets alone given will determine the number of partitions
                created.

                The optional partitioning scheme parameter forces a particular
                partitioning scheme; if not specified, a suitable default is
                chosen.  They are:

                      ++oo   AAPPMM[[FFoorrmmaatt]] specifies that an Apple Partition Map
                          scheme should be used.  This is the traditional
                          Apple partitioning scheme used to start up a Pow-
                          erPC-based Macintosh computer, to use the disk as a
                          non-startup disk with any Mac, or to create a multi-
                          platform compatible startup disk.

                      ++oo   MMBBRR[[FFoorrmmaatt]] specifies that a Master Boot Record
                          scheme should be used.  This is the DOS/Windows-com-
                          patible partitioning scheme.

                      ++oo   GGPPTT[[FFoorrmmaatt]] specifies that a GUID Partitioning Table
                          scheme should be used.  This is the partitioning
                          scheme used to start up an Intel-based Macintosh
                          computer.

                For each partition, a triplet of the desired file system for-
                mat, volume name, and size must be specified.  Several other
                ddiisskkuuttiill verbs allow these triplets as well (and for them, the
                _n_u_m_b_e_r_O_f_P_a_r_t_i_t_i_o_n_s parameter is also optional).  The triplets
                must be as follows:

                      ++oo   _F_o_r_m_a_t names are of the form jhfs+, HFS+, MS-DOS,
                          etc.; a list of formattable file systems (more pre-
                          cisely, specific file system personalities exported
                          by the installed file system bundles) and common
                          aliases is available from the lliissttFFiilleessyysstteemmss verb.

                          _F_o_r_m_a_t guides ddiisskkuuttiill both in what partition type
                          to set for the partitions (slices) as well as what
                          file system structures to initialize therein, using
                          the file system bundle's plist's FormatExecutable
                          setting which usually points to the appropriate for-
                          matter program such as newfs_hfs(8).

                          You can specify a _f_o_r_m_a_t of FFrreeee SSppaaccee to skip an
                          area of the disk.

                          You can specify the partition type manually and
                          directly with a _f_o_r_m_a_t of %<human-readable partition
                          type>% such as %%AAppppllee__HHFFSS%% or %<GPT partition type
                          UUID constant>% such as
                          %%4488446655330000--00000000--1111AAAA--AAAA1111--0000330066554433EECCAACC%%;; these imply
                          a _n_a_m_e of %%nnooffoorrmmaatt%% (below).  Human-readable types
                          must be known to the system but UUID types (GPT
                          scheme only) can be arbitrary.

                      ++oo   _N_a_m_e_s are the initial volume names; they must con-
                          form to file system specific restrictions.

                          If a name of %%nnooffoorrmmaatt%% is specified, then the par-
                          tition is left blank such that the partition space
                          is carved out, the partition type is set according
                          to the file system format name or explicit type, the
                          partition space is partially erased (""wiped""), but a
                          file system structure is not initialized with any
                          file system's formatter program (e.g.  newfs_hfs(8);
                          this is useful for setting up partitions that will
                          contain user-defined (not necessarily file system)
                          data.

                          For a triplet whose _f_o_r_m_a_t is FFrreeee SSppaaccee or a
                          directly-specified partition type, its _n_a_m_e is
                          ignored but a dummy name must nevertheless be
                          present.

                      ++oo   _S_i_z_e_s are floating point numbers followed by a let-
                          ter or percent sign as described in the SSIIZZEESS sec-
                          tion at the end of this page (e.g. 165536000, 55.3T,
                          678M, 75%, R).

                In addition to explicitly-requested partitions, space (gaps)
                might be allocated to satisfy certain filesystems' position
                and length alignment requirements; space might be allocated
                for possible future booter partition insertion; and indeed,
                actual booter partitions might be implicitly created.

                In particular, there is a rule that unrecognized partitions
                1GiB or larger automatically acquire booters.  Thus, if you
                create an arbitrary partition with e.g.  ddiisskkuuttiill
                ppaarrttiittiioonnDDiisskk ddiisskk00 ggpptt %%1111111122222222--11111111--22222222--11111111--111111112222222211111111%%

                also be created. You can always delete that booter with
                ddiisskkuuttiill eerraasseeVVoolluummee """"FFrreeee SSppaaccee"""" dduummmmyy ddiisskk00ss33.

                The last partition is usually automatically lengthened to the
                end of the partition map (disk).  You can specify an exact
                size for your last partition by specifying it as the penulti-
                mate triplet and specifying an additional (last) triplet as
                FFrreeee SSppaaccee.  Or you can use the RR (remainder) size specifier
                for one of your middle partitions while specifying an exact
                size for your last partition.

                Ownership of the affected disk is required.

                Non-destructively resize a volume (partition); you may
                increase or decrease its size.  Alternatively, take no action
                and print information.

                Specifying lliimmiittss instead of _s_i_z_e takes no action, but instead
                prints the range of valid values for the target partition,
                taking into account current file system and partition map con-
                ditions such as files in use and other (immovable) partitions
                following the target.

                Specifying mmaappssiizzee instead of _s_i_z_e takes no action, but
                instead prints the size of the encompassing whole-disk device,
                as well as the size of the entire partition map (all parti-
                tions less map overhead). The whole-disk device might be
                larger than the partition map if the whole-disk device has
                grown since the partition map was created. Growing a whole-
                disk device is possible with certain enterprise disk (RAID)
                systems.

                The --pplliisstt option will print partition or whole-disk size
                inquiry information in property list format.

                You can grow a volume (partition) (back) to its maximum size
                possible, provided no new partitions have been created that
                are in the way, by specifying RR for the new volume size. You
                should use RR instead of attempting an absolute value such as
                110000%% because the latter cannot count partition map overhead.

                When decreasing the size, new partitions may optionally be
                created to fill the newly-freed space.  To do this, specify
                the _n_u_m_b_e_r_O_f_P_a_r_t_i_t_i_o_n_s_, _f_o_r_m_a_t_, _n_a_m_e_, and _s_i_z_e parameters in
                the same manner as the triplet description for the

                Resizing a volume that is currently set as the computer's
                startup disk will invalidate that setting; use the SSttaarrttuupp

                Destructively split a volume into multiple partitions.  You
                must supply a list of new partitions to create in the space of
                the old partition; specify these with the _n_u_m_b_e_r_O_f_P_a_r_t_i_t_i_o_n_s_,
                _f_o_r_m_a_t_, _n_a_m_e_, and _s_i_z_e parameters in the same manner as the
                triplet description for the ppaarrttiittiioonnDDiisskk verb.

                For one of your triplets, you can optionally specify the RR
                meta-size in lieu of a constant number value for the _s_i_z_e
                parameter: the substituted value will be exactly the amount of
                space necessary to complete the re-filling of the original
                partition with all of your triplets.

                _D_e_v_i_c_e refers to a volume.  Ownership of the affected disk is
                required.

                Merge two or more partitions on a disk.  All data on merged
                partitions other than the first will be lost.  Data on the
                first partition will be lost as well if the ffoorrccee argument is
                given.

                If ffoorrccee is not given, and the first partition has a resizable
                file system (e.g. JHFS+), the file system will be preserved
                and grown in a data-preserving manner; your _f_o_r_m_a_t and _n_a_m_e
                parameters are ignored in this case. If ffoorrccee is not given,
                and the first partition is not resizable, you are prompted if
                you want to format.  You will also be prompted to format if
                the first partition has an (HFS) Allocation Block Size which
                is too small to support the required growth of the first par-
                tition; see the --bb option for nneewwffss__hhffss (8).

                If ffoorrccee is given, the final resulting partition is always
                (re)formatted. You should do this if you wish to (re)format to
                a new file system type.  You will be prompted to confirm.

                _F_o_r_m_a_t and _n_a_m_e must always be given, but they have an effect
                only when ffoorrccee is given.

                Merged partitions are required to be ordered sequentially on
                disk (see ddiisskkuuttiill lliisstt for the actual on-disk ordering).  All
                partitions in the range, except for the first one, must be
                unmountable.  Ownership of the affected disk is required.

     AAPPFFSS | aapp _a_p_f_s_V_e_r_b [...]
                Apple APFS is a system of virtual volumes.  APFS verbs can be
                used to create, manipulate and destroy APFS Containers and
                their APFS Volumes.  Apple APFS defines these types of
                objects:

                      ++oo   Container - An APFS Container imports one or more
                          APFS Physical Store disks and exports zero or more
                          APFS Volume disks.  Zero or more APFS Containers can
                          exist in (might be attached to) the system at any
                          one time.

                          While attached, the ""handle"" by which an APFS Con-
                          tainer is identified is by its APFS CCoonnttaaiinneerr
                          RReeffeerreennccee disk (device). You should treat this as an
                          opaque reference token.

                          The CCoonnttaaiinneerr RReeffeerreennccee disk is a synthesized whole-
                          disk which is exported by APFS for identification
                          purposes only; it has no storage. It is associated
                          with the AppleAPFSContainerScheme node in the IO
                          Registry. While APFS Volume device identifiers
                          appear to be of a related form, you should never use
                          the Container Reference as a basis to create device
                          identifiers yourself; use the listing verbs with
                          their plist options instead.

                      ++oo   Physical Store - An APFS Physical Store is a disk
                          which is imported into (that is, which backs, indeed
                          defines) an APFS Container. An APFS Container can
                          import more than one Physical Store, e.g. for
                          Fusion-style Containers.

                          An APFS Physical Store disk is not necessarily a
                          disk from a partition map; it could be e.g. an
                          AppleRAID Set disk. Therefore, you must never assume
                          that an APFS Physical Store's disk identifier is a
                          2-part form such as disk0s2.

                      ++oo   Volume - An APFS Volume is an [un]mountable file
                          system volume which is exported from an APFS Con-
                          tainer.  Zero or more APFS Volumes may be exported
                          out of an APFS Container.

                          APFS Volumes have no specified ""size"" (capacity).
                          Instead, all APFS Volumes consume capacity out of
                          the remaining free space of their parent APFS Con-
                          tainer, consuming or returning such capacity as user
                          file data is added or deleted. Note that this means
                          that all Volumes within a Container compete for the
                          Container's remaining capacity. However, you can
                          manage Volume allocation with the optional rreesseerrvvee
                          and qquuoottaa size values.

                          The optional rreesseerrvvee size requests an assured mini-
                          mum capacity for an APFS Volume. If successfully
                          created, the Volume is guaranteed to be able to
                          store at least this many bytes of user file data.
                          Note that beyond this, the Volume might be able to
                          store even more until constrained by reaching zero
                          free space in its parent Container or by reaching a
                          quota, if any. You can use a rreesseerrvvee to prevent run-
                          ning out of capacity due to competition from other
                          Volumes or from a Container shrink attempt.

                          The optional qquuoottaa size applies a maximum capacity
                          to an APFS Volume, placing a limit on the number of
                          bytes of user file data which can be stored on the
                          Volume. Note that you might not be able to reach
                          this limit if its parent Container becomes full
                          first. You can use a qquuoottaa to enforce accounting or
                          to manage against ""unfair"" premature filling-up of
                          the parent Container due solely to this Volume at
                          the expense of sibling Volumes.

                          Efficient file copy cloning (copy-on-write) is sup-
                          ported (see ccooppyyffiillee (3)'s COPYFILE_CLONE).

                          Optional file-level encryption is supported.

                          The format of an APFS Volume's device identifier is
                          that of a slice disk of a special whole-disk; both
                          disks are synthesized by APFS. The ""whole"" identi-
                          fier number (a positive possibly-multi-digit inte-
                          ger) is arbitrary, and the ""slice"" numbers (positive
                          possibly-multi-digit integers) count up from 1 with
                          each new Volume. Deleting Volumes may cause gaps in
                          the numbering.  This form appears the same as a par-
                          tition (map) scheme and partitions, but it is com-
                          pletely unrelated.  For example: If ""disk3s2"" is a
                          Physical Store defining a Container, then ""disk5s1"",
                          ""disk5s2"", and ""disk5s3"" might be the Container's
                          Volumes; ""disk5"" exists but is never used directly.

                          Although it has a device node, an APFS Volume's data
                          may only be accessed through its files; you cannot
                          open an APFS Volume device node to ""directly"" access
                          its on-disk bytes.

                      ++oo   Snapshot - An APFS Snapshot represents a read-only
                          copy of its parent APFS Volume, frozen at the moment
                          of its creation.  An APFS Volume can have zero or
                          more associated APFS Snapshots.

                          APFS Snapshots are neither listed nor discoverable
                          when their Volume is not mounted. Snapshots are
                          uniquely identified within their parent Volume's
                          namespace by either a numeric identifier (preferred)
                          or by their name; Snapshots can be renamed, but APFS
                          will never allow duplication of names (within a Vol-
                          ume) to occur.

                          APFS Snapshots are mountable; when this occurs, its
                          mount point (separate from and simultaneous with its
                          parent Volume) provides a read-only historic version
                          of the Volume content at Snapshot creation time.

                          You can rreevveerrtt the present state of an APFS Volume
                          back to equality with a Snapshot in its history.
                          This is a destructive reset/restore operation: Once
                          a Volume is reverted, it cannot be brought forward.
                          Any Snaphots between the revert point and the
                          present are lost as well.

                          You can ddeelleettee a Snapshot; this removes the possi-
                          bility of ever reverting to that Snapshot's state,
                          but does not affect the Volume's present-time con-
                          tent.

                          An APFS Snapshot mount point's ""source device"" (its
                          ssttaattffss (2) f_mntfromname shown by mmoouunntt (8)) is not
                          a device node (e.g. disk0s2) as is common; it is the
                          Snapshot name followed by the '@' character and the
                          ""parent"" Volume's device node, e.g. ""Snap-
                          Name123@/dev/disk2s1"".  See mmoouunntt__aappffss --ss (8) and

                APFS itself has no provision for backing up your data.  Back-
                ups should be always be performed on a regular basis and
                before modifying any APFS Container using these commands.

                The following is a list of AAPPFFSS sub-verbs with their descrip-
                tions and individual arguments.

                           Non-destructively convert an HFS volume to an APFS
                           Container with a single (but see below) APFS Vol-
                           ume. The APFS Container can later be manipulated
                           (e.g. adding and deleting APFS Volumes) as usual.
                           This verb can be used to convert nonbootable
                           ""data""-only volumes as well as ""macOS"" volumes (see
                           below).

                           The source HFS volume can be located on a GPT par-
                           tition or on an encrypted or non-encrypted, Fusion
                           or non-Fusion CoreStorage logical volume (LV).  In
                           the latter case, the CoreStorage logical volume
                           group (LVG) is dismantled, including automatic
                           removal of any related Boot Camp Assistant parti-
                           tion(s).

                           If --ddrryyrruunn is specified, all calculations, checks,

                           part of the conversion process to facilitate macOS
                           bootstrap.  Normally your directory should be
                           writable; additional (cryptographic and EFI render-
                           ing) items are automatically added to your direc-
                           tory prior to conversion and are not removed after-
                           wards.  You can opt-out of automatic item addition

                           Destroy an existing APFS Container, including all
                           of its APFS Volumes.  You can identify the APFS
                           Container by its Container Reference disk (pre-
                           ferred), or by its Physical Store disk.

                           The APFS Volumes are unmounted first; this process
                           may not succeed if one or more is busy. If this
                           happens, the operation is aborted and everything is
                           left intact.  Otherwise, all APFS Volumes are
                           deleted as well as its APFS Container, and the APFS
                           Container's former Physical Store disks will be
                           reformatted as HFS; data on all APFS Volumes will
                           be lost.

                           You can optionally specify a new _n_a_m_e, or else
                           ""Untitled"" will be chosen.  If there were multiple
                           Physical Stores, a space and a number suffix is
                           added for each.

                           If your APFS Container is damaged, a Container Ref-
                           erence for it might not exist or it might not be
                           functional. In this case, you can reclaim your for-
                           mer APFS Physical Store disk(s) by specifying the
                           --ffoorrccee option; this activates an alternate last-
                           resort mode. In this mode, if you had more than one
                           Physical Store (e.g. the Fusion case) and the Con-
                           tainer is sufficiently damaged, you might have to
                           delete each Physical Store manually.  You should
                           normally avoid this mode.

                           Resize an existing APFS Container by specifying
                           either an APFS Container Reference (preferred) or
                           an APFS Physical Store partition, plus a proposed
                           new size.  Alternatively, take no action and print
                           constraint information.  The operation is live,
                           non-destructive, and does not mount or unmount any
                           APFS Volumes.

                           If you specify an APFS Container Reference and that
                           Container imports more than one Physical Store (in
                           e.g. Fusion setups), the appropriate Physical Store
                           will be chosen automatically.

                           Specifying lliimmiittss instead of a _s_i_z_e causes no
                           action to be taken, but instead prints a range of
                           valid values, taking into account various con-
                           straints; the --pplliisstt option will print this infor-
                           mation in property list format.

                           Shrinks are constrained by the amount of data usage
                           by all APFS Volumes on the targeted or implied APFS
                           Container.  Contributing to this data usage is the
                           file content on the APFS Volumes, the existence of
                           quotas and/or reserves, the usage of APFS Snapshots
                           (e.g. by Time Machine), and metadata overhead.

                           Grows are constrained by the amount of partition
                           map free space trailing the targeted or implied
                           Physical Store partition.

                           When shrinking, new partitions may optionally be
                           created to fill the newly-freed space.  To do this,
                           specify the _f_o_r_m_a_t_, _n_a_m_e_, and _s_i_z_e parameters in
                           the same manner as the triplet description for the
                           ppaarrttiittiioonnDDiisskk verb.

                           You can specify a _s_i_z_e of zero ((00)) to grow the tar-
                           geted APFS Physical Store such that all remaining
                           space is filled to the next partition or the end of
                           the partition map.

                           Ownership of the affected disks is required, and
                           all APFS Volumes on the Container must be unlocked.

                           tainer. Files can then be stored on this newly-cre-
                           ated APFS Volume.

                           The _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m parameter sets the permanent APFS
                           personality for this new APFS Volume; you should
                           specify AAPPFFSS or CCaassee--sseennssiittiivvee AAPPFFSS..

                           The new APFS Volume will be unencrypted unless you
                           specify one of the passphrase options, in which
                           case the volume will be encrypted from the begin-
                           ning of its existence (as opposed to having encryp-
                           tion applied later); the user which is added will
                           be the ""Disk User"".  The optional _p_a_s_s_p_h_r_a_s_e_H_i_n_t is
                           a user-defined string that can be displayed even
                           while an encrypted APFS Volume is locked.

                           APFS Volumes have no fixed size; they allocate
                           backing store on an as-needed basis.  You can spec-
                           ify the _r_e_s_e_r_v_e parameter to guarantee a minimum
                           amount of space for your volume; at least that many
                           bytes will be available for file data.  You can
                           also specify the _q_u_o_t_a parameter to limit your vol-
                           ume's file usage to a maximum amount; no more than
                           that many bytes will be available for file data,
                           even if there is otherwise enough space in the par-
                           ent APFS Container.  You can specify both _r_e_s_e_r_v_e
                           and _q_u_o_t_a simultaneously; however, the reserve is
                           not allowed to be larger than the quota.

                           APFS Volumes can carry certain metadata hint flags;
                           you can supply the _r_o_l_e parameter with any combina-
                           tion of one or more of the characters BBRRVVII,, or 00 as
                           a no-op for scripting convenience.

                           The new APFS Volume is explicitly mounted after
                           creation; you can specify --nnoommoouunntt to leave it
                           unmounted, or, you can supply a ""custom"" _m_o_u_n_t_p_o_i_n_t
                           path, in which case you must be root, the directory
                           must already exist, and you must delete the direc-
                           tory yourself when you unmount.

                           If you do not supply the --uusseerr option, then all
                           cryptographic users on that APFS Volume are

                           the Disk UUID (which equals the APFS Volume UUID)
                           user is assumed; if you supply --uusseerr with a UUID
                           then that specific user is assumed; if you instead
                           supply --rreeccoovveerryykkeeyycchhaaiinn then the Institutional
                           Recovery user (see below) is assumed.

                           You will be prompted interactively for a passphrase
                           unless you specify a passphrase parameter with
                           --ppaasssspphhrraassee or pipe your passphrase into stdin and

                           As an alternative to a passphrase, you can specify

                           must be unlocked; see security(1) and fdesetup(8)
                           for more information.

                           You can skip the explicit mounting step with the
                           --nnoommoouunntt option, or specify a ""custom"" mountpoint
                           with the --mmoouunnttppooiinntt option. If you specify your
                           own mountpoint path, it must exist and you must
                           have write privileges on it (e.g. usually you must
                           be root).

                           Specifying --vveerriiffyy will test passphrase correctness
                           without affecting the locked or unlocked state.

                           If --pplliisstt is specified, then a property list will

                           put; additional details are available here.

                           To re-lock the volume, unmount it, e.g. with

                           The usual purpose of an APFS Cryptographic User is

                           of its users can do so.

                           An APFS Volume need not be encrypted in order to
                           contain crypto users; indeed, other than the Disk
                           User, they should be added before encrypting.

                           Types of Cryptographic Users include at-most-one-
                           per-Volume ""Disk"" user, whose UUID value always
                           matches its Volume's UUID; iCloud or personal
                           ""Recovery Keys"", which are not users per se, but
                           instead store partial crypto keys and are associ-
                           ated with corresponding ""Recovery Users"" and have
                           fixed-constant UUID values; and ""Open Directory""

                           macOS Open Directory account user GUIDs.

                AppleRAID verbs can be used to create, manipulate and destroy
                AppleRAID volumes (Software RAID).  AppleRAID supports three
                basic types of RAID sets:

                      ++oo   ""stripe"" - Striped Volume (RAID 0)

                      ++oo   ""mirror"" - Mirrored Volume (RAID 1)

                      ++oo   ""concat"" - Concatenated Volume (Spanning)

                Of these three basic types, only the ""mirror"" type increases
                fault-tolerance.  Mirrors may have more than two disks to fur-
                ther increase their fault-tolerance.  Striped and concaten-
                tated volumes are, in fact, more vulnerable to faults than
                single disk volumes.

                From these basic types, ""stacked"" or ""nested"" RAID volumes can
                be created.  Stacked RAID sets that make use of mirrored RAID
                sets are fault-tolerant.  For example, these are some of the
                more common combinations of stacked RAID sets:

                      ++oo   RAID 50 - A striped RAID set of hardware RAID 5
                          disks.

                      ++oo   RAID 10 - A striped RAID set of mirrored RAID sets.

                      ++oo   RAID 0+1 - A mirrored RAID set of striped RAID sets.

                      ++oo   Concatenated Mirror - A concatenation of mirrored
                          RAID sets.

                When creating new RAID sets or adding disks, if possible, it
                is better to specify the entire disk instead of a partition on
                that disk.  This allows the software to reformat the entire
                disk using the most current partition layouts.  When using
                whole disks, the type of partitioning used is selected based
                on the platform type (PPC = APMFormat, Intel = GPTFormat).
                GPT and APM partition formats cannot be mixed in the same RAID
                set.

                In addition to whole disk and partition device names,
                AppleRAID uses UUIDs to refer to existing RAID sets and their
                members.  Existing RAID sets may also be specified by mount
                point (e.g.  _/_V_o_l_u_m_e_/_r_a_i_d_s_e_t). In many cases, using the UUID
                for the device argument is preferred because disk device names
                may change over time when disks are added, disks are removed
                or when the system is rebooted.  If RAID members have been
                physically disconnected from the system or are no longer
                responding, you must use the member's UUID as the command
                argument.  Messages in the system log will refer to RAID sets
                and their member disks by UUID.  For more information on spec-
                ifying device arguments, see the DDEEVVIICCEESS section below.

                AppleRAID is not a replacement for backing up your data.
                Backups should be always be performed on a regular basis and
                before modifying any RAID set using these commands.

                CoreStorage verbs can be used to create, manipulate and
                destroy CoreStorage volumes.

                CoreStorage maintains a world of virtual disks, somewhat like
                RAID, in which one can easily add or remove imported backing
                store disks, as well as exported usable volumes, to or from a
                pool (or several pools). This provides the user with flexibil-
                ity in allocating their hardware; user or operating system
                data can span multiple physical disks seamlessly, for example.

                Apple CoreStorage defines four types of objects, instances of
                which are uniquely represented by a UUID:

                      ++oo   Logical Volume Group (LVG)

                      ++oo   Physical Volume (PV)

                      ++oo   Logical Volume Family (LVF)

                      ++oo   Logical Volume (LV)

                The Logical Volume Group (LVG) is the top or ""pool"" level;
                zero or more may exist during any OS boot time session.

                An LVG imports one or more Physical Volumes (PVs). A PV repre-
                sents a device that feeds the LVG storage space; a PV is nor-
                mally real media but it can be a disk image or even an
                AppleRAID Set. A disk offered to be a PV must be a partition
                and the encompassing scheme must be GPT.

                An LVG exports zero or more Logical Volume Families (LVFs). An
                LVF contains properties which govern and bind together all of
                its descendant Logical Volumes (LVs). These properties provide
                settings for Full Disk Encryption (FDE) (such as whether the
                LVG is encrypted, which users have access, etc) and other ser-
                vices.  However, at the present time, for new LVF creation,
                only zero or one LVF per LVG is supported.

                A Logical Volume Family (LVF) exports one or more Logical Vol-
                umes (LVs).  However, at the present time, only and exactly
                one LV per LVF is supported.

                A Logical Volume (LV) exports a dev node, upon which a file
                system (such as Journaled HFS+) resides.

                For more information on specifying device arguments, see the
                DDEEVVIICCEESS section below.

                CoreStorage is not a replacement for backing up your data.
                Backups should be always be performed on a regular basis and
                before modifying any CoreStorage volumes using these commands.

                The following is a list of ccoorreeSSttoorraaggee sub-verbs with their
                descriptions and individual arguments.

                lliisstt [--pplliisstt | _U_U_I_D]
                           Display a tree view of the CoreStorage world for
                           all current logical volume groups (LVGs) with mem-
                           ber disks (PVs) and exported volumes (LVFs and
                           LVs), with properties and status for each level.
                           If --pplliisstt is specified then a property list will be
                           emitted instead of the formatted tree output; the
                           UUIDs can be used with the ddiisskkuuttiill ccoorreeSSttoorraaggee

                           represented by that UUID.  If _U_U_I_D is specified
                           then an attempt is made to list only that UUID
                           (whatever type of CoreStorage object it may repre-
                           sent).  The --pplliisstt and _U_U_I_D arguments may not both
                           be specified.

                           Convert a regular Journaled HFS+ or Case-sensitive
                           Journaled HFS+ volume (must be on a partition and
                           within a GPT partitioning scheme) into a CoreStor-
                           age logical volume.

                           If --ppaasssspphhrraassee is specified, the on-disk bytes will
                           be encrypted. You will be prompted for a new
                           passphrase interactively, or you can specify the
                           _p_a_s_s_p_h_r_a_s_e on the command line. Alternatively, if
                           you specify --ssttddiinnppaasssspphhrraassee the standard input is
                           read for the passphrase so that a program could
                           execute ddiisskkuuttiill and send the passphrase through a
                           pipe without having to expose it as a command-line
                           parameter.

                           The volume is encrypted with an FDE ""Disk""
                           passphrase, which is distinct from the ""User"" ID
                           and passphrase combination which FileVault asso-
                           ciates with a volume.  Therefore, if you want to
                           encrypt a macOS ""OS-bearing"" volume (with its user
                           accounts), you must use FileVault in Security Pref-
                           erences or the contextual menu in the Finder.

                           The volume must be resizable (the above types are)
                           and also mounted. Conversion is done live and in-
                           place; targeting the boot volume is supported; as
                           much of the conversion as possible is done before
                           an eject or reboot is necessary.

                           After slightly shrinking the source volume to make
                           room for CoreStorage data structures at the end,
                           its partition type is changed to Apple_CoreStorage
                           and it becomes a CoreStorage Physical Volume.  A
                           new CoreStorage Logical Volume Group is then cre-
                           ated with this Physical Volume as the backing
                           store, followed by the creation of a Logical Volume
                           Family and Logical Volume pair.

                           At this point, the new CoreStorage PV/LVG/LVF/LV
                           stack is ready for use, although the ""old"" mount-
                           point must first be unmounted; yet it might not be
                           unmountable. This will occur if the target (now the
                           PV) is the current boot volume.

                           Just before exiting, ddiisskkuuttiill ccoorreeSSttoorraaggee ccoonnvveerrtt
                           will try to unmount the target disk (which is now
                           the ""old"" mount point and the new PV). If success-
                           ful (target is not the boot disk), the volume now
                           becomes mounted from the LV. If unsuccessful (tar-
                           get is the boot disk), a reboot is necessary.

                           At this point, if no encryption was specified, all
                           is done. Otherwise, the bytes-on-disk will begin to
                           be encrypted in-place by CoreStorage automatically
                           ""in the background"" while the PV/LVG/LVF/LV stack
                           continues to be usable. Encryption progress may be
                           monitored with ddiisskkuuttiill ccoorreeSSttoorraaggee lliisstt..

                           When encryption is finished, a Disk passphrase will
                           be required the next time the LV is ejected and re-
                           attached.  If the LV is hosting the boot volume,
                           this passphrase requirement will thus occur at the
                           next reboot.

                           Note that all on-disk data is not secured immedi-
                           ately; it is a deliberate process of encrypting all
                           on-disk bytes while the CoreStorage driver keeps
                           publishing the (usable) LVG/LV.

                           Ownership of the affected disk is required.

                           native type.  The volume must have been created by
                           means of conversion, e.g. with ddiisskkuuttiill ccoorreeSSttoorraaggee

                           then simple ownership of the affected disk is
                           required; otherwise, a Disk passphrase must be sup-
                           plied, either interactively or via one of the
                           parameters or a keychain file in the same manner as

                           You can specify partitions (which will be re-typed

                           It is assumed that the logical volume is used as a

                           That is, the on-disk bytes that are backing the
                           user data are all visited, read, and re-written in
                           an encrypted form; this process can take a long
                           time (minutes to hours). This process continues
                           seamlessly across reboots. The logical volume
                           remains usable at all times.  When this command
                           returns, the operation will be ongoing; you can

                           The entire logical volume family (LVF) is affected
                           since all LVs in an LVF share the same encryption
                           settings.

                           Any new user data written while this background
                           operation is in progress will be in encrypted form.

                           The volume is encrypted with an FDE ""Disk""

                           and passphrase combination which FileVault asso-
                           ciates with a volume.  Therefore, if you want to
                           encrypt a macOS ""OS-bearing"" volume (with its user
                           accounts), you must use FileVault in Security Pref-

                           Unlock a logical volume and file system, causing it
                           to be attached and mounted.

                           Data is then accessible in plain form to the file
                           system and applications, while the on-physical-disk
                           backing bytes remain in encrypted form.

                           The locked state means that the CoreStorage driver
                           has not been given authentication information (a
                           passphrase) to interpret the encrypted bytes on
                           disk and thus export a dev node.  This verb unlocks
                           a logical volume family (LVF) and its logical vol-
                           umes (LVs) by providing that authentication; as the
                           LVs thus appear as dev nodes, any file systems upon
                           them are automatically mounted unless the --nnoommoouunntt

                           To re-lock the volume, make it offline again by

                           A new passphrase must then be supplied, again via

                           a newline character.

                           Only the Disk passphrase is supported; you cannot

                           Resize a physical volume (PV). If you shrink a PV,

                           group (LVG); if you grow a PV, more space becomes
                           available. The partition in which the PV resides is
                           changed to accommodate, and the associated booter
                           partition, if present, is automatically moved.

                           Note that you cannot ordinarily grow a PV unless
                           there is free space in the partition map beyond it;
                           note also that you cannot ordinarily shrink a PV
                           unless the LVG has some free space in it (e.g. by
                           shrinking an overlying LV first).

                           When decreasing the size (shrinking), new parti-
                           tions may optionally be created to fill the newly-

                           Combine the actions of ddiisskkuuttiill ccoorreeSSttoorraaggee
                           rreessiizzeePPVV and ddiisskkuuttiill ccoorreeSSttoorraaggee rreessiizzeeLLVV in the
                           correct sequence in order to effect a shrink or a
                           grow in an entire LVG setup.

                           This is done by making a change to the size of a
                           logical volume (LV), after or before which (one of
                           its) physical volume(s) (PV) also changes its size
                           accordingly.  The (HFS) file system ""on top of"" the
                           LV and the disk partition ""below"" the PV, as well
                           as the location of the PV's associated booter par-
                           tition, are automatically adjusted.

                           When decreasing the size (shrinking), new parti-
                           tions may optionally be created to fill the newly-
                           freed space.  To do this, specify the _f_o_r_m_a_t_, _n_a_m_e_,
                           and _s_i_z_e parameters in the same manner as the
                           triplet description for the ppaarrttiittiioonnDDiisskk verb.

                           Since an LVG might have one (e.g. Full Disk Encryp-
                           tion (FDE), aka FileVault), two (e.g. Fusion), or
                           even three (certain Boot Camp configurations) PVs,
                           a specific PV must be chosen. You can have this
                           command choose one for you, or you can specify the
                           PV UUID directly. If you do not specify a PV, the
                           one which has previously been marked for this pur-
                           pose is used; if no mark, a policy algorithm is
                           applied.

                           If your new LV size represents a grow of the exist-
                           ing LV size, then the PV size will take up more
                           space on disk, thus creating a larger LVG for the
                           larger LV to live in.  If your new LV size repre-
                           sents a shrink, then the PV size will take up less
                           space on disk, thus creating a smaller LVG, which
                           is enough for the smaller LV to live in. The magni-
                           tude of the size change you specify (which is for
                           the LV) causes an exact size change in the PV if
                           you conform to partition rounding (alignment)
                           restrictions; the corresponding LV change may be
                           greater because it is under additional alignment
                           restrictions imposed by CoreStorage and HFS.

                           The ""spilling over"" of size change effects from one
                           PV onto another is not supported; only and exactly
                           one PV is affected by this operation. Grows or
                           shrinks whose effects don't ""fit"" the designated PV
                           will result in an error message and no effect.  For
                           example, you can't do a shrink on a multi-PV setup
                           such that the designated PV should shrink to zero
                           size and so effectively should disappear.  Nor can
                           you do a grow which would necessitate the growth of
                           some other PV or the addition of new PVs.

                           As in ddiisskkuuttiill ccoorreeSSttoorraaggee rreessiizzeePPVV, note that you
                           cannot grow unless there is free space in the par-
                           tition map beyond the designated PV, which is not
                           normally the case because you usually don't leave
                           gaps of free space on your disk.

                           You can specify a _s_i_z_e of zero ((00)) to fill up all
                           remaining space to the partition following the des-
                           ignated PV's booter or to the end of the partition
                           map, if possible.

DDEEVVIICCEESS
     A device parameter for any of the above commands (except where explicitly
     required otherwise) can usually be any of the following:

           ++oo   The ddiisskk iiddeennttiiffiieerr (see below).  Any entry of the form of
               _d_i_s_k_*, e.g.  _d_i_s_k_1_s_9.

           ++oo   The device node entry containing the ddiisskk iiddeennttiiffiieerr.  Any
               entry of the form of _/_d_e_v_/_[_r_]_d_i_s_k_*, e.g.  _/_d_e_v_/_d_i_s_k_2.

           ++oo   The volume mount point.  Any entry of the form of _/_V_o_l_u_m_e_s_/_*,
               e.g.  _/_V_o_l_u_m_e_s_/_U_n_t_i_t_l_e_d.  In most cases, a ""custom"" mount point
               e.g.  _/_y_o_u_r_/_c_u_s_t_o_m_/_m_o_u_n_t_p_o_i_n_t_/_h_e_r_e is also accepted.

           ++oo   The URL form of any of the volume mount point forms described
               above.  E.g.  _f_i_l_e_:_/_/_/_V_o_l_u_m_e_s_/_U_n_t_i_t_l_e_d or _f_i_l_e_:_/_/_/.

           ++oo   A UUID.  Any entry of the form of e.g.
               _1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_-_2_2_2_2_-_3_3_3_3_-_4_4_4_4_-_5_5_5_5_5_5_5_5_5_5_5_5.  The UUID can be a
               ""media"" UUID which IOKit places in an IOMedia node as derived
               from e.g. a GPT map's partition UUID, or it can be an AppleRAID
               (or CoreStorage) set (LV) or member (PV) UUID.

           ++oo   A volume name, e.g.  _U_n_t_i_t_l_e_d.  This match is only attempted if
               the given device is not of the form _[_/_d_e_v_/_]_[_r_]_d_i_s_k_*, nor
               _[_/_V_o_l_u_m_e_s_/_]_*.  The match attempt is against the intrinsic vol-
               ume label, not against the terminal component, if mounted, of
               its mount point.

DDIISSKK IIDDEENNTTIIFFIIEERR
     The (BSD) ddiisskk iiddeennttiiffiieerr string variously identifies a physical or logi-
     cal device unit, a session (if any) upon that device, a partition (slice)
     upon that session (if any), or a virtual logical volume.  It may take the
     form of _d_i_s_k_U, _d_i_s_k_U_s_S, _d_i_s_k_U_s_Q, or _d_i_s_k_C_s_V, where U, C, S, Q and V are
     positive decimal integers (possibly multi-digit), and where:

           ++oo   _U is the device unit.  It may refer to hardware (e.g. a hard
               drive, optical drive, or memory card) or a virtual ""drive"" con-
               structed by software (e.g. an AppleRAID Set, disk image,
               CoreStorage LV, etc).

           ++oo   _C is an APFS Container.  This is a a virtual disk constructed
               by APFS to represent a collection of APFS Volumes.

           ++oo   _Q is the session and is only included for optical media; it
               refers to the number of times recording has taken place on the
               currently-inserted medium (disc).

           ++oo   _S is the ""slice""; it refers to a partition.  Upon this parti-
               tion, the raw data that underlies a user-visible file system is
               usually present, but it may also contain specialized data for
               certain 3rd-party database programs, or data required for the
               system software (e.g. EFI partitions, booter partitions, APM
               partition map data, etc), or, notably, it might contain back-
               ing-store physical volumes for AppleRAID, CoreStorage, APFS, or
               3rd-party Storage Systems.

           ++oo   _V is an APFS Volume; it refers to a virtual logical volume that
               is shared out of an APFS Container.  For example, if an
               Apple_APFS-typed partition is on disk5s2, then disk5s2 is
               termed the APFS Physical Store which is imported into an APFS
               Container. The APFS Container might then export e.g. disk8s1,
               which is termed an APFS Volume, which is mountable as a file
               system. Multiple APFS Volumes can be exported from a single
               APFS Container.

     Some units (e.g. floppy disks, RAID sets) contain file system data upon
     their ""whole"" device instead of containing a partitioning scheme with
     partitions.

     Note that some of the forms appear the same and must be distinguished by
     context.  For example, _d_i_s_k_U_s_Q, _d_i_s_k_U_s_S, and _d_i_s_k_C_s_V are all 2-part forms
     that can mean different things: For non-optical media, it identifies a
     partition (on a partition map) upon which (file system) data is stored;
     for optical media, it identifies a session upon which an entire partition
     map (with its partitions with file systems) is stored; for an APFS setup,
     it identifies an APFS Volume. As another example, in ""stacked"" cases
     (CoreStorage on AppleRAID or APFS on AppleRAID), the 1-part _d_i_s_k_U form
     becomes a CoreStorage PV or APFS PhysicalStore, in contrast with the
     more-common 2-part form.

     It is important for software to avoid relying on numerical ordering of
     any of the parts.  Activities including but not limited to partition
     deletions and insertions, partition resizing, virtual volume deletions
     and additions, device ejects and attachments due to media insertion
     cycles, plug cycles, authentication lock cycles or reboots, can all cause
     (temporary) gaps and non-increments in the numerical ordering of any of
     the parts. You must rely on more persistent means of identification, such
     as the various UUIDs.

SSIIZZEESS
     Wherever a size is emitted as an oouuttppuutt, it is presented as a base-ten
     approximation to the precision of one fractional decimal digit and a
     base-ten SI multiplier, often accompanied by a precise count in bytes.
     Scripts should refrain from parsing this human-readable output and use
     the --pplliisstt option instead.

     Wherever a _s_i_z_e is to be supplied by you as an iinnppuutt, you can provide
     values in a number of different ways, some absolute and some context-sen-
     sitive.  Values are interpreted as base ten and must be positive with no
     preceding ""+"".  An integer without a suffix is taken to mean an exact
     number of bytes (e.g. 5368709120).  Multiplier suffixes are optional,
     must follow your value immediately without whitespace, and allow your
     value to be a real number (e.g. 5.1234t).  Some of the specifiers below
     should not have a preceding value at all (e.g. the letter RR for ""remain-
     der"").

     Power-of-ten suffixes:

           ++oo   BB is bbyytteess (not blocks) where the multiplier is 1.  This suffix
               may be omitted.

           ++oo   KK[[BB]] is power of ten kkiilloobbyytteess where the multiplier is 1000 (1
               x 10^3).

           ++oo   MM[[BB]] is power of ten mmeeggaabbyytteess where the multiplier is 1000000
               (1 x 10^6).

           ++oo   GG[[BB]] is power of ten ggiiggaabbyytteess where the multiplier is
               1000000000 (1 x 10^9).

           ++oo   TT[[BB]] is power of ten tteerraabbyytteess where the multiplier is
               1000000000000 (1 x 10^12).

           ++oo   PP[[BB]] is power of ten ppeettaabbyytteess where the multiplier is
               1000000000000000 (1 x 10^15).

           ++oo   EE[[BB]] is power of ten eexxaabbyytteess where the multiplier is
               1000000000000000000 (1 x 10^18).

     Power-of-two suffixes:

           ++oo   KKii[[BB]] is power of two kkiibbiibbyytteess where the multiplier is 1024 (1
               x 2^10).

           ++oo   MMii[[BB]] is power of two mmeebbiibbyytteess where the multiplier is 1048576
               (1 x 2^20).

           ++oo   GGii[[BB]] is power of two ggiibbiibbyytteess where the multiplier is
               1073741824 (1 x 2^30).

           ++oo   TTii[[BB]] is power of two tteebbiibbyytteess where the multiplier is
               1099511627776 (1 x 2^40).

           ++oo   PPii[[BB]] is power of two ppeebbiibbyytteess where the multiplier is
               1125899906842624 (1 x 2^50).

           ++oo   EEii[[BB]] is power of two eexxbbiibbyytteess where the multiplier is
               1152921504606846976 (1 x 2^60).

     The following are useful when working with devices and partition maps:

           ++oo   SS | UUAAMM (""sectors"") is 551122--bbyyttee uunniittss (device-independent)
               where the multiplier is always 512.

           ++oo   DDBBSS (""device block size"") is the ddeevviiccee--ddeeppeennddeenntt native block
               size of the encompassing whole disk, if applicable, where the
               multiplier is often 512, but not always; indeed it might not be
               a power of two.

     In certain contexts (e.g. when asking to ""use all space available"", or
     when building partition triplets) you can provide a relative value as
     follows:

           ++oo   00 (the number zero) is a request to allocate ""all possible"".
               This may mean different things in different contexts.  For par-
               tition maps, this requests allocation until the start of the
               following partition or the end of the partition map's allocat-
               able space.

           ++oo   %% (with a preceding number) is a ppeerrcceennttaaggee of the whole-disk
               size, the partition map size, or other allocatable size, as
               appropriate by context.  Use of %% is not supported in all situ-
               ations.

           ++oo   RR (with no preceding number) specifies the rreemmaaiinnddeerr of the
               whole-disk size or other allocatable size after all other
               triplets in the group are taken into account.  It need not be
               in the last triplet.  It must only appear in at most one
               triplet among all triplets.  Use of RR is not supported in all
               situations; in some such cases, a value of 00 is more appropri-
               ate.

     You can provide an operating system-defined constant value as follows:

           ++oo   %%rreeccoovveerryy%% (with no preceding number) is the customary size of
               pre-macOS-13.0 Recovery Partitions.

     Note again that BB refers to bytes and SS and UUAAMM refer to a constant mul-
     tiplier of 512; the latter are useful when working with tools such as ggpptt
     (8) or ddff (1).  Note also that this multiplier is not a ""block"" size as
     actually implemented by the underlying device driver and/or hardware, nor
     is it an ""allocation block"", which is a file system's minimum unit of
     backing store usage, often formatting-option-dependent.

     Examples: 10G (10 gigabytes), 4.23tb (4.23 terabytes), 5M (5 megabytes),
     4GiB (exactly 2^32 bytes), 126000 (exactly 126000 bytes), 25.4% (25.4
     percent of whole disk size).

     The _f_o_r_m_a_t parameter for the erasing and partitioning verbs is the file
     system personality name.  You can determine this name by looking in a
     file system bundle's
     _/_S_y_s_t_e_m_/_L_i_b_r_a_r_y_/_F_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m_s_/_<_f_s_>_._f_s_/_C_o_n_t_e_n_t_s_/_I_n_f_o_._p_l_i_s_t and looking at
     the keys for the FFSSPPeerrssoonnaalliittiieess dictionary, or by using the
     lliissttFFiilleessyysstteemmss verb, which also lists shortcut aliases for common per-
     sonalities (these shortcuts are defined by ddiisskkuuttiill for use with it
     only).

     Common examples include JHFS+, JHFSX, MS-DOS, etc, as nicknames for the
     canonical forms from the file system bundles such as ""Case-sensitive
     HFS+"".

     The eraseDisk and partitionDisk verbs had an option to add Mac OS 9 driv-
     ers (in partitions designated for that purpose); there was also a
     repairOS9Permissions verb.  These have been removed.

     Starting with Mac OS X 10.6, the input and output notation of disk and
     partition sizes use power-of-10 suffixes.  In the past this had been
     power-of-2, regardless of the suffix (e.g. G, Gi, GiB) used for display
     or accepted as input.  Starting with Mac OS X 10.11, the BB suffix is
     optional even for ""bare"" numeric values.

     Starting with Mac OS X 10.11, the verify- and repairPermissions verbs
     have been removed.

     Starting with macOS 10.12, the plist output of partitions from ddiisskkuuttiill
     lliisstt --pplliisstt is presented in on-disk (not BSD slice name, e.g. disk0s2)
     order. This mimics the order of outputs from programs such as ggpptt (1).
     The human-readable output always has been, and remains, in on-disk order.

     Starting with macOS 10.13.2, APFS cryptographic user authentication is
     required even when disabling FileVault.

     Starting with macOS 10.14, partitions on all media above 1GiB in size
     will default to 1MiB alignment, regardless of the partitioning scheme.
     This is significant for MBR partition maps and their use in appliances
     such as cameras. Free-space requests will not be aligned.

     The nneettssttaatt command symbolically displays the contents of various net-
     work-related data structures.  There are a number of output formats,
     depending on the options for the information presented.  The first form
     of the command displays a list of active sockets for each protocol.  The
     second form presents the contents of one of the other network data struc-
     tures according to the option selected. Using the third form, with a _w_a_i_t
     interval specified, nneettssttaatt will continuously display the information
     regarding packet traffic on the configured network interfaces.  The
     fourth form displays statistics for the specified protocol or address
     family. If a _w_a_i_t interval is specified, the protocol information over
     the last interval seconds will be displayed.  The fifth form displays
     per-interface statistics for the specified protocol or address family.
     The sixth form displays mbuf(9) statistics.  The seventh form displays
     routing table for the specified address family.  The eighth form displays
     routing statistics.

     The options have the following meaning:

     --AA    With the default display, show the address of any protocol control
           blocks associated with sockets and the flow hash; used for debug-
           ging.

     --aa    With the default display, show the state of all sockets; normally
           sockets used by server processes are not shown. With the routing
           table display (option --rr, as described below), show protocol-cloned
           routes (routes generated by a RTF_PRCLONING parent route); normally
           these routes are not shown.

     --bb    With the interface display (option --ii, as described below), show
           the number of bytes in and out.

     --cc _q_u_e_u_e
           With the queue statistics (option --qq, as described below), show
           only those for the specified _q_u_e_u_e.

     --dd    With either interface display (option --ii or an interval, as
           described below), show the number of dropped packets.

     --ff _a_d_d_r_e_s_s___f_a_m_i_l_y
           Limit statistics or address control block reports to those of the
           specified _a_d_d_r_e_s_s _f_a_m_i_l_y.  The following address families are rec-
           ognized: _i_n_e_t, for AF_INET, _i_n_e_t_6, for AF_INET6 and _u_n_i_x, for
           AF_UNIX.

     --gg    Show information related to multicast (group address) membership.
           If the --ss option is also present, show extended interface group
           management statistics.  If the --vv option is specified, show link-
           layer memberships; they are suppressed by default.  Source lists
           for each group will also be printed.  Specifiying --vv twice will
           print the control plane timers for each interface and the source
           list counters for each group.  If the --ii is specified, only that
           interface will be shown.  If the --ff is specified, only information
           for the address family will be displayed.

     --II _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e
           Show information about the specified interface; used with a _w_a_i_t
           interval as described below.  If the --ss option is present, show
           per-interface protocol statistics on the _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e for the speci-
           fied _a_d_d_r_e_s_s___f_a_m_i_l_y or _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l, or for all protocol families.

     --ii    Show the state of interfaces which have been auto-configured
           (interfaces statically configured into a system, but not located at
           boot time are not shown).  If the --aa options is also present, mul-
           ticast addresses currently in use are shown for each Ethernet
           interface and for each IP interface address.  Multicast addresses
           are shown on separate lines following the interface address with
           which they are associated.  If the --ss option is present, show per-
           interface statistics on all interfaces for the specified
           _a_d_d_r_e_s_s___f_a_m_i_l_y or _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l, or for all protocol families.

     --LL    Show the size of the various listen queues.  The first count shows
           the number of unaccepted connections.  The second count shows the
           amount of unaccepted incomplete connections.  The third count is
           the maximum number of queued connections.

     --ll    Print full IPv6 address.

     --mm    Show statistics recorded by the memory management routines (the
           network stack manages a private pool of memory buffers). More
           detailed information about the buffers, which includes their cache
           related statistics, can be obtained by using --mmmm or --mm --mm option.

     --nn    Show network addresses as numbers (normally nneettssttaatt interprets
           addresses and attempts to display them symbolically).  This option
           may be used with any of the display formats.

     --pp _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l
           Show statistics about _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l, which is either a well-known name
           for a protocol or an alias for it.  Some protocol names and aliases
           are listed in the file _/_e_t_c_/_p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s.  The special protocol name
           ``bdg'' is used to show bridging statistics.  A null response typi-
           cally means that there are no interesting numbers to report.  The
           program will complain if _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l is unknown or if there is no sta-
           tistics routine for it.

     --qq    Show network interface send queue statistics.  By default all
           queues are displayed, unless specified with --cc.  This option
           requires specifying an interface with --II option.  More detailed
           information about the queues, which includes their queueing algo-
           rithm related statistics, can be obtained by using --qqqq or --qq --qq
           option.

     --rr    Show the routing tables.  Use with --aa to show protocol-cloned
           routes.  When --ss is also present, show routing statistics instead.
           When --ll is also present, nneettssttaatt assumes more columns are there and
           the maximum transmission unit.  More detailed information about the
           route metrics are displayed with --llll for TCP round trip times --llllll
           for all metrics.  Use the --zz flags to display only entries with
           non-zero RTT values.  (``mtu'') are also displayed.

     --RR    Show reachability information.  Use with --ii to show link-layer
           reachability information for a given interface.

     --ss    Show per-protocol statistics.  If this option is repeated, counters
           with a value of zero are suppressed.  For security reasons, root
           privileges are required to read TCP statistics and in the absence
           of such privileges all TCP counters will be reported as zero.

     --SS    Show interface link status and interface state information about
           the specified interface.  This option requires specifying an inter-
           face with --II option.

     --vv    Increase verbosity level.

     --WW    In certain displays, avoid truncating addresses even if this causes
           some fields to overflow.

     --ww _w_a_i_t
           Show network interface or protocol statistics at intervals of _w_a_i_t
           seconds.

     --xx    Show extended link-layer reachability information in addition to
           that shown by the --RR flag.

OOUUTTPPUUTT
     The default display, for active sockets, shows the local and remote
     addresses, send and receive queue sizes (in bytes), protocol, and the
     internal state of the protocol.  Address formats are of the form
     ``host.port'' or ``network.port'' if a socket's address specifies a net-
     work but no specific host address.  If known, the host and network
     addresses are displayed symbolically according to the databases
     _/_e_t_c_/_h_o_s_t_s and _/_e_t_c_/_n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s, respectively.  If a symbolic name for an
     address is unknown, or if the --nn option is specified, the address is
     printed numerically, according to the address family.  For more informa-
     tion regarding the Internet ``dot format'', refer to inet(3)).  Unspeci-
     fied, or ``wildcard'', addresses and ports appear as ``*''.

     Internet domain socket states:

     CLOSED:  The socket is not in use.

     LISTEN:  The socket is listening for incoming connections.  Unconnected
     listening sockets like these are only displayed when using the -a option.

     SYN_SENT:  The socket is actively trying to establish a connection to a
     remote peer.

     SYN_RCVD:  The socket has passively received a connection request from a
     remote peer.

     ESTABLISHED:  The socket has an established connection between a local
     application and a remote peer.

     CLOSE_WAIT:  The socket connection has been closed by the remote peer,
     and the system is waiting for the local application to close its half of
     the connection.

     LAST_ACK:  The socket connection has been closed by the remote peer, the
     local application has closed its half of the connection, and the system
     is waiting for the remote peer to acknowledge the close.

     FIN_WAIT_1:  The socket connection has been closed by the local
     application, the remote peer has not yet acknowledged the close, and the
     system is waiting for it to close its half of the connection.

     FIN_WAIT_2:  The socket connection has been closed by the local
     application, the remote peer has acknowledged the close, and the system
     is waiting for it to close its half of the connection.

     CLOSING:  The socket connection has been closed by the local application
     and the remote peer simultaneously, and the remote peer has not yet
     acknowledged the close attempt of the local application.

     TIME_WAIT:  The socket connection has been closed by the local
     application, the remote peer has closed its half of the connection, and
     the system is waiting to be sure that the remote peer received the last
     acknowledgement.

     The interface display provides a table of cumulative statistics regarding
     packets transferred, errors, and collisions.  The network addresses of
     the interface and the maximum transmission unit (``mtu'') are also dis-
     played.

     The routing table display indicates the available routes and their sta-
     tus.  Each route consists of a destination host or network and a gateway
     to use in forwarding packets.  The flags field shows a collection of
     information about the route stored as binary choices.  The individual
     flags are discussed in more detail in the route(8) and route(4) manual
     pages.  The mapping between letters and flags is:

     1       RTF_PROTO1       Protocol specific routing flag #1
     2       RTF_PROTO2       Protocol specific routing flag #2
     3       RTF_PROTO3       Protocol specific routing flag #3
     B       RTF_BLACKHOLE    Just discard packets (during updates)
     b       RTF_BROADCAST    The route represents a broadcast address
     C       RTF_CLONING      Generate new routes on use
     c       RTF_PRCLONING    Protocol-specified generate new routes on use
     D       RTF_DYNAMIC      Created dynamically (by redirect)
     G       RTF_GATEWAY      Destination requires forwarding by intermediary
     H       RTF_HOST         Host entry (net otherwise)
     I       RTF_IFSCOPE      Route is associated with an interface scope
     i       RTF_IFREF        Route is holding a reference to the interface
     L       RTF_LLINFO       Valid protocol to link address translation
     M       RTF_MODIFIED     Modified dynamically (by redirect)
     m       RTF_MULTICAST    The route represents a multicast address
     R       RTF_REJECT       Host or net unreachable
     r       RTF_ROUTER       Host is a default router
     S       RTF_STATIC       Manually added
     U       RTF_UP           Route usable
     W       RTF_WASCLONED    Route was generated as a result of cloning
     X       RTF_XRESOLVE     External daemon translates proto to link address
     Y       RTF_PROXY        Proxying; cloned routes will not be scoped

     Direct routes are created for each interface attached to the local host;
     the gateway field for such entries shows the address of the outgoing
     interface.  The refcnt field gives the current number of active uses of
     the route.  Connection oriented protocols normally hold on to a single
     route for the duration of a connection while connectionless protocols
     obtain a route while sending to the same destination.  The use field pro-
     vides a count of the number of packets sent using that route.  The inter-
     face entry indicates the network interface utilized for the route.  A
     route which is marked with the RTF_IFSCOPE flag is instantiated for the
     corresponding interface.  A cloning route which is marked with the
     RTF_PROXY flag will not generate new routes that are associated with its
     interface scope.

     When nneettssttaatt is invoked with the --ww option and a _w_a_i_t interval argument,
     it displays a running count of statistics related to network interfaces
     or protocols.  An obsolete version of this option used a numeric parame-
     ter with no option, and is currently supported for backward compatibil-
     ity.  By default, this display summarizes information for all interfaces.
     Information for a specific interface may be displayed with the --II option.

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This manual page documents version 5.04 of the ffiillee command.

     ffiillee tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  There are three
     sets of tests, performed in this order: filesystem tests, magic tests,
     and language tests.  The _f_i_r_s_t test that succeeds causes the file type to
     be printed.

     The type printed will usually contain one of the words _t_e_x_t (the file
     contains only printing characters and a few common control characters and
     is probably safe to read on an ASCII terminal), _e_x_e_c_u_t_a_b_l_e (the file con-
     tains the result of compiling a program in a form understandable to some
     UNIX kernel or another), or _d_a_t_a meaning anything else (data is usually
     ``binary'' or non-printable).  Exceptions are well-known file formats
     (core files, tar archives) that are known to contain binary data.  When
     modifying magic files or the program itself, make sure to _p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e _t_h_e_s_e
     _k_e_y_w_o_r_d_s.  Users depend on knowing that all the readable files in a
     directory have the word ``text'' printed.  Don't do as Berkeley did and
     change ``shell commands text'' to ``shell script''.

     The filesystem tests are based on examining the return from a stat(2)
     system call.  The program checks to see if the file is empty, or if it's
     some sort of special file.  Any known file types appropriate to the sys-
     tem you are running on (sockets, symbolic links, or named pipes (FIFOs)
     on those systems that implement them) are intuited if they are defined in
     the system header file <_s_y_s_/_s_t_a_t_._h>.

     The magic tests are used to check for files with data in particular fixed
     formats.  The canonical example of this is a binary executable (compiled
     program) a.out file, whose format is defined in <_e_l_f_._h>, <_a_._o_u_t_._h> and
     possibly <_e_x_e_c_._h> in the standard include directory.  These files have a
     ``magic number'' stored in a particular place near the beginning of the
     file that tells the UNIX operating system that the file is a binary exe-
     cutable, and which of several types thereof.  The concept of a ``magic''
     has been applied by extension to data files.  Any file with some invari-
     ant identifier at a small fixed offset into the file can usually be
     described in this way.  The information identifying these files is read
     from the compiled magic file _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_f_i_l_e_/_m_a_g_i_c_._m_g_c, or the files in
     the directory _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_f_i_l_e_/_m_a_g_i_c if the compiled file does not exist.

     If a file does not match any of the entries in the magic file, it is
     examined to see if it seems to be a text file.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non-
     ISO 8-bit extended-ASCII character sets (such as those used on Macintosh
     and IBM PC systems), UTF-8-encoded Unicode, UTF-16-encoded Unicode, and
     EBCDIC character sets can be distinguished by the different ranges and
     sequences of bytes that constitute printable text in each set.  If a file
     passes any of these tests, its character set is reported.  ASCII,
     ISO-8859-x, UTF-8, and extended-ASCII files are identified as ``text''
     because they will be mostly readable on nearly any terminal; UTF-16 and
     EBCDIC are only ``character data'' because, while they contain text, it
     is text that will require translation before it can be read.  In addi-
     tion, ffiillee will attempt to determine other characteristics of text-type
     files.  If the lines of a file are terminated by CR, CRLF, or NEL,
     instead of the Unix-standard LF, this will be reported.  Files that con-
     tain embedded escape sequences or overstriking will also be identified.

     Once ffiillee has determined the character set used in a text-type file, it
     will attempt to determine in what language the file is written.  The lan-
     guage tests look for particular strings (cf.  <_n_a_m_e_s_._h>) that can appear
     anywhere in the first few blocks of a file.  For example, the keyword _._b_r
     indicates that the file is most likely a troff(1) input file, just as the
     keyword _s_t_r_u_c_t indicates a C program.  These tests are less reliable than
     the previous two groups, so they are performed last.  The language test
     routines also test for some miscellany (such as tar(1) archives).

     Any file that cannot be identified as having been written in any of the
     character sets listed above is simply said to be ``data''.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     ----aappppllee
             Causes the file command to output the file type and creator code
             as used by older MacOS versions. The code consists of eight let-
             ters, the first describing the file type, the latter the creator.

     --bb, ----bbrriieeff
             Do not prepend filenames to output lines (brief mode).

     --CC, ----ccoommppiillee
             Write a _m_a_g_i_c_._m_g_c output file that contains a pre-parsed version
             of the magic file or directory.

     --cc, ----cchheecckkiinngg--pprriinnttoouutt
             Cause a checking printout of the parsed form of the magic file.
             This is usually used in conjunction with the --mm flag to debug a
             new magic file before installing it.

     --CC, ----ccoommppiillee
             Write a _m_a_g_i_c_._m_g_c output file that contains a pre-parsed version
             of the magic file or directory.

     --dd      Apply the default system tests; this is the default behavior
             unless --MM is specified.

     --DD      Print debugging messages.

     --EE      On filesystem errors (file not found etc), instead of handling
             the error as regular output as POSIX mandates and keep going,
             issue an error message and exit.

     --ee, ----eexxcclluuddee _t_e_s_t_n_a_m_e
             Exclude the test named in _t_e_s_t_n_a_m_e from the list of tests made to
             determine the file type.  Valid test names are:

             apptype   EMX application type (only on EMX).

             ascii     Various types of text files (this test will try to
                       guess the text encoding, irrespective of the setting of
                       the `encoding' option).

             encoding  Different text encodings for soft magic tests.

             tokens    Ignored for backwards compatibility.

             cdf       Prints details of Compound Document Files.

             compress  Checks for, and looks inside, compressed files.

             elf       Prints ELF file details, provided soft magic tests are
                       enabled and the elf magic is found.

             soft      Consults magic files.

             tar       Examines tar files.

     ----eexxtteennssiioonn
             Print a slash-separated list of valid extensions for the file
             type found.

     --FF, ----sseeppaarraattoorr _s_e_p_a_r_a_t_o_r
             Use the specified string as the separator between the filename
             and the file result returned.  Defaults to `:'.

     --ff, ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e
             Read the names of the files to be examined from _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e (one per
             line) before the argument list.  Either _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e or at least one
             filename argument must be present; to test the standard input,
             use `-' as a filename argument.  Please note that _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e is
             unwrapped and the enclosed filenames are processed when this
             option is encountered and before any further options processing
             is done.  This allows one to process multiple lists of files with
             different command line arguments on the same ffiillee invocation.
             Thus if you want to set the delimiter, you need to do it before
             you specify the list of files, like: ``--FF _@ --ff _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e'',
             instead of: ``--ff _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e --FF _@''.

     --hh, ----nnoo--ddeerreeffeerreennccee
             option causes symlinks not to be followed (on systems that sup-
             port symbolic links).

     --ii      If the file is a regular file, do not classify its contents.

     --II, ----mmiimmee
             Causes the file command to output mime type strings rather than
             the more traditional human readable ones.  Thus it may say
             `text/plain; charset=us-ascii' rather than ``ASCII text''.

     ----mmiimmee--ttyyppee, ----mmiimmee--eennccooddiinngg
             Like --II, but print only the specified element(s).

     --kk, ----kkeeeepp--ggooiinngg
             Don't stop at the first match, keep going.  Subsequent matches
             will be have the string `\012- ' prepended.  (If you want a new-
             line, see the --rr option.)  The magic pattern with the highest
             strength (see the --ll option) comes first.

     --ll, ----lliisstt
             Shows a list of patterns and their strength sorted descending by
             magic(4) strength which is used for the matching (see also the --kk
             option).

     --LL, ----ddeerreeffeerreennccee
             option causes symlinks to be followed, as the like-named option
             in ls(1) (on systems that support symbolic links).  This is the
             default behavior.

     --mm, ----mmaaggiicc--ffiillee _l_i_s_t
             Specify an alternate list of files and directories containing
             magic.  This can be a single item, or a colon-separated list.  If
             a compiled magic file is found alongside a file or directory, it
             will be used instead.

     --MM _l_i_s_t
             Like --mm, except that the default rules are not applied unless --dd
             is specified.

     --nn, ----nnoo--bbuuffffeerr
             Force stdout to be flushed after checking each file.  This is
             only useful if checking a list of files.  It is intended to be
             used by programs that want filetype output from a pipe.

     --pp, ----pprreesseerrvvee--ddaattee
             On systems that support utime(3) or utimes(2), attempt to pre-
             serve the access time of files analyzed, to pretend that ffiillee
             never read them.

     --rr, ----rraaww
             No operation, included for historical compatibility.

     --ss, ----ssppeecciiaall--ffiilleess
             Normally, ffiillee only attempts to read and determine the type of
             argument files which stat(2) reports are ordinary files.  This
             prevents problems, because reading special files may have pecu-
             liar consequences.  Specifying the --ss option causes ffiillee to also
             read argument files which are block or character special files.
             This is useful for determining the filesystem types of the data
             in raw disk partitions, which are block special files.  This
             option also causes ffiillee to disregard the file size as reported by
             stat(2) since on some systems it reports a zero size for raw disk
             partitions.

     --vv, ----vveerrssiioonn
             Print the version of the program and exit.

     --zz, ----uunnccoommpprreessss
             Try to look inside compressed files.

     --ZZ, ----uunnccoommpprreessss--nnoorreeppoorrtt
             Try to look inside compressed files, but report information about
             the contents only not the compression.

     --00, ----pprriinntt00
             Output a null character `\0' after the end of the filename.  Nice

     In legacy mode, the --DD, --II, and --MM options do not exist.

     The --dd, --ii, and --rr options behave differently.  The --dd option provides
     debugging information (same as --DD in conformance mode).  The --ii option
     displays mime type information (same as --II in conformance mode).  The --rr
     option will disable the translation of unprintable characters (by
     default, this translation is already disabled in conformance mode).

     Furthermore, the --hh option becomes the default symlink behavior (don't

     This program conforms to Version 3 of the Single UNIX Specification
     (``SUSv3'').  Its behavior is mostly compatible with the System V program
     of the same name.  This version knows more magic, however, so it will
     produce different (albeit more accurate) output in many cases.

     The one significant difference between this version and System V is that
     this version treats any white space as a delimiter, so that spaces in
     pattern strings must be escaped.  For example,

           >10     string  language impress        (imPRESS data)

     in an existing magic file would have to be changed to

           >10     string  language\ impress       (imPRESS data)

     In addition, in this version, if a pattern string contains a backslash,
     it must be escaped.  For example

           0       string          \begindata      Andrew Toolkit document

     in an existing magic file would have to be changed to

           0       string          \\begindata     Andrew Toolkit document

     SunOS releases 3.2 and later from Sun Microsystems include a ffiillee command
     derived from the System V one, but with some extensions.  This version
     differs from Sun's only in minor ways.  It includes the extension of the
     `&' operator, used as, for example,

           >16     long&0x7fffffff >0              not stripped

     The magic file entries have been collected from various sources, mainly
     USENET, and contributed by various authors.  Christos Zoulas (address
     below) will collect additional or corrected magic file entries.  A con-
     solidation of magic file entries will be distributed periodically.

     The order of entries in the magic file is significant.  Depending on what
     system you are using, the order that they are put together may be incor-

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     There has been a ffiillee command in every UNIX since at least Research
     Version 4 (man page dated November, 1973).  The System V version intro-
     duced one significant major change: the external list of magic types.
     This slowed the program down slightly but made it a lot more flexible.

     This program, based on the System V version, was written by Ian Darwin
     <ian@darwinsys.com> without looking at anybody else's source code.

     John Gilmore revised the code extensively, making it better than the
     first version.  Geoff Collyer found several inadequacies and provided
     some magic file entries.  Contributions of the `&' operator by Rob McMa-
     hon, <cudcv@warwick.ac.uk>, 1989.

     Guy Harris, <guy@netapp.com>, made many changes from 1993 to the present.

     Primary development and maintenance from 1990 to the present by Christos
     Zoulas <christos@astron.com>.

     Altered by Chris Lowth <chris@lowth.com>, 2000: handle the --II option to
     output mime type strings, using an alternative magic file and internal
     logic.

     Altered by Eric Fischer <enf@pobox.com>, July, 2000, to identify charac-
     ter codes and attempt to identify the languages of non-ASCII files.

     Altered by Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>, 2007-2011, to improve MIME sup-
     port, merge MIME and non-MIME magic, support directories as well as files
     of magic, apply many bug fixes, update and fix a lot of magic, improve
     the build system, improve the documentation, and rewrite the Python bind-
     ings in pure Python.

     The list of contributors to the `magic' directory (magic files) is too
     long to include here.  You know who you are; thank you.  Many contribu-
     tors are listed in the source files.

     Fix output so that tests for MIME and APPLE flags are not needed all over
     the place, and actual output is only done in one place.  This needs a
     design.  Suggestion: push possible outputs on to a list, then pick the
     last-pushed (most specific, one hopes) value at the end, or use a default
     if the list is empty.  This should not slow down evaluation.

     The handling of MAGIC_CONTINUE and printing \012- between entries is
     clumsy and complicated; refactor and centralize.

     Some of the encoding logic is hard-coded in encoding.c and can be moved
     to the magic files if we had a !:charset annotation

     Continue to squash all magic bugs.  See Debian BTS for a good source.

     Store arbitrarily long strings, for example for %s patterns, so that they
     can be printed out.  Fixes Debian bug #271672.  This can be done by allo-
     cating strings in a string pool, storing the string pool at the end of
     the magic file and converting all the string pointers to relative offsets
     from the string pool.

     Add syntax for relative offsets after current level (Debian bug #466037).

     Make file -ki work, i.e. give multiple MIME types.

     Add a zip library so we can peek inside Office2007 documents to print
     more details about their contents.

     Add an option to print URLs for the sources of the file descriptions.

     Combine script searches and add a way to map executable names to MIME
     types (e.g. have a magic value for !:mime which causes the resulting
     string to be looked up in a table).  This would avoid adding the same
     magic repeatedly for each new hash-bang interpreter.

     When a file descriptor is available, we can skip and adjust the buffer
     instead of the hacky buffer management we do now.

     Fix ``name'' and ``use'' to check for consistency at compile time (dupli-
     cate ``name'', ``use'' pointing to undefined ``name'' ).  Make ``name'' /
     ``use'' more efficient by keeping a sorted list of names.  Special-case ^
     to flip endianness in the parser so that it does not have to be escaped,
     and document it.

     If the offsets specified internally in the file exceed the buffer size (
     HOWMANY variable in file.h), then we don't seek to that offset, but we
     give up.  It would be better if buffer managements was done when the file
     descriptor is available so move around the file.  One must be careful
     though because this has performance (and thus security considerations).

     When invoked without arguments, the ddaattee utility displays the current
     date and time.  Otherwise, depending on the options specified, ddaattee will
     set the date and time or print it in a user-defined way.

     The ddaattee utility displays the date and time read from the kernel clock.
     When used to set the date and time, both the kernel clock and the hard-
     ware clock are updated.

     Only the superuser may set the date, and if the system securelevel (see
     securelevel(7)) is greater than 1, the time may not be changed by more
     than 1 second.

     The options are as follows:

     --dd _d_s_t  Set the kernel's value for daylight saving time.  If _d_s_t is non-
             zero, future calls to gettimeofday(2) will return a non-zero for
             _t_z___d_s_t_t_i_m_e.

     --ff      Use _i_n_p_u_t___f_m_t as the format string to parse the _n_e_w___d_a_t_e provided
             rather than using the default [[[_m_m]_d_d]_H_H]_M_M[[_c_c]_y_y][_._s_s] format.
             Parsing is done using strptime(3).

     --jj      Do not try to set the date.  This allows you to use the --ff flag
             in addition to the ++ option to convert one date format to
             another.

     --nn      By default, if the timed(8) daemon is running, ddaattee sets the time
             on all of the machines in the local group.  The --nn option sup-
             presses this behavior and causes the time to be set only on the
             current machine.

     --RR      Use RFC 2822 date and time output format. This is equivalent to
             use ``%a, %d %b %Y %T %z'' as _o_u_t_p_u_t___f_m_t while LC_TIME is set to
             the ``C'' locale .

     --rr _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
             Print the date and time represented by _s_e_c_o_n_d_s, where _s_e_c_o_n_d_s is
             the number of seconds since the Epoch (00:00:00 UTC, January 1,
             1970; see time(3)), and can be specified in decimal, octal, or
             hex.

     --rr _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
             Print the date and time of the last modification of _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.

     --tt _m_i_n_u_t_e_s___w_e_s_t
             Set the system's value for minutes west of GMT.  _m_i_n_u_t_e_s___w_e_s_t
             specifies the number of minutes returned in _t_z___m_i_n_u_t_e_s_w_e_s_t by
             future calls to gettimeofday(2).

     --uu      Display or set the date in UTC (Coordinated Universal) time.

     --vv      Adjust (i.e., take the current date and display the result of the
             adjustment; not actually set the date) the second, minute, hour,
             month day, week day, month or year according to _v_a_l.  If _v_a_l is
             preceded with a plus or minus sign, the date is adjusted forwards
             or backwards according to the remaining string, otherwise the
             relevant part of the date is set.  The date can be adjusted as
             many times as required using these flags.  Flags are processed in
             the order given.

             When setting values (rather than adjusting them), seconds are in
             the range 0-59, minutes are in the range 0-59, hours are in the
             range 0-23, month days are in the range 1-31, week days are in
             the range 0-6 (Sun-Sat), months are in the range 1-12 (Jan-Dec)
             and years are in the range 80-38 or 1980-2038.

             If _v_a_l is numeric, one of either _y, _m, _w, _d, _H, _M or _S must be
             used to specify which part of the date is to be adjusted.

             The week day or month may be specified using a name rather than a
             number.  If a name is used with the plus (or minus) sign, the
             date will be put forwards (or backwards) to the next (previous)
             date that matches the given week day or month.  This will not
             adjust the date, if the given week day or month is the same as
             the current one.

             When a date is adjusted to a specific value or in units greater
             than hours, daylight savings time considerations are ignored.
             Adjustments in units of hours or less honor daylight saving time.
             So, assuming the current date is March 26, 0:30 and that the DST
             adjustment means that the clock goes forward at 01:00 to 02:00,
             using --vv +1H will adjust the date to March 26, 2:30.  Likewise,
             if the date is October 29, 0:30 and the DST adjustment means that
             the clock goes back at 02:00 to 01:00, using --vv +3H will be nec-
             essary to reach October 29, 2:30.

             When the date is adjusted to a specific value that does not actu-
             ally exist (for example March 26, 1:30 BST 2000 in the
             Europe/London timezone), the date will be silently adjusted for-
             wards in units of one hour until it reaches a valid time.  When
             the date is adjusted to a specific value that occurs twice (for
             example October 29, 1:30 2000), the resulting timezone will be
             set so that the date matches the earlier of the two times.

             It is not possible to adjust a date to an invalid absolute day,
             so using the switches --vv 31d --vv 12m will simply fail five months
             of the year.  It is therefore usual to set the month before set-
             ting the day; using --vv 12m --vv 31d always works.

             Adjusting the date by months is inherently ambiguous because a
             month is a unit of variable length depending on the current date.
             This kind of date adjustment is applied in the most intuitive
             way.  First of all, ddaattee tries to preserve the day of the month.
             If it is impossible because the target month is shorter than the
             present one, the last day of the target month will be the result.
             For example, using --vv +1m on May 31 will adjust the date to June
             30, while using the same option on January 30 will result in the
             date adjusted to the last day of February.  This approach is also
             believed to make the most sense for shell scripting.  Neverthe-
             less, be aware that going forth and back by the same number of
             months may take you to a different date.

             Refer to the examples below for further details.

     An operand with a leading plus (`+') sign signals a user-defined format
     string which specifies the format in which to display the date and time.
     The format string may contain any of the conversion specifications
     described in the strftime(3) manual page, as well as any arbitrary text.
     A newline (`\n') character is always output after the characters speci-
     fied by the format string.  The format string for the default display is
     ``+%+''.

     If an operand does not have a leading plus sign, it is interpreted as a
     value for setting the system's notion of the current date and time.  The
     canonical representation for setting the date and time is:

           _c_c      Century (either 19 or 20) prepended to the abbreviated
                   year.
           _y_y      Year in abbreviated form (e.g., 89 for 1989, 06 for 2006).
           _m_m      Numeric month, a number from 1 to 12.
           _d_d      Day, a number from 1 to 31.
           _H_H      Hour, a number from 0 to 23.
           _M_M      Minutes, a number from 0 to 59.
           _s_s      Seconds, a number from 0 to 61 (59 plus a maximum of two
                   leap seconds).

     Everything but the minutes is optional.

     Time changes for Daylight Saving Time, standard time, leap seconds, and
     leap years are handled automatically.

     So will the command:

           date -v3m -v30d -v0y -v-1m

     because there is no such date as the 30th of February.

     The command:

     where it is currently Mon Aug  4 04:31:11 BST 1997.

     The command:

           date 0613162785

     sets the date to ``June 13, 1985, 4:27 PM''.

           date ""+%m%d%H%M%Y.%S""

     may be used on one machine to print out the date suitable for setting on

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ppiinngg utility uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram
     to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.  ECHO_REQUEST
     datagrams (``pings'') have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a ``struct
     timeval'' and then an arbitrary number of ``pad'' bytes used to fill out
     the packet.  The options are as follows:

     --AA      Audible.  Output a bell (ASCII 0x07) character when no packet is
             received before the next packet is transmitted.  To cater for
             round-trip times that are longer than the interval between trans-
             missions, further missing packets cause a bell only if the maxi-
             mum number of unreceived packets has increased.

     --aa      Audible.  Include a bell (ASCII 0x07) character in the output
             when any packet is received.  This option is ignored if other
             format options are present.

     --bb _b_o_u_n_d_i_f
             Bind the socket to interface _b_o_u_n_d_i_f for sending.  This option is
             an Apple addition.

     --CC      Prohibit the socket from using the cellular network interface.
             This option is an Apple addition.

     --cc _c_o_u_n_t
             Stop after sending (and receiving) _c_o_u_n_t ECHO_RESPONSE packets.
             If this option is not specified, ppiinngg will operate until inter-
             rupted.  If this option is specified in conjunction with ping
             sweeps, each sweep will consist of _c_o_u_n_t packets.

     --DD      Set the Don't Fragment bit.

     --dd      Set the SO_DEBUG option on the socket being used.

     --ff      Flood ping.  Outputs packets as fast as they come back or one
             hundred times per second, whichever is more.  For every
             ECHO_REQUEST sent a period ``.'' is printed, while for every
             ECHO_REPLY received a backspace is printed.  This provides a
             rapid display of how many packets are being dropped.  Only the
             super-user may use this option.  _T_h_i_s _c_a_n _b_e _v_e_r_y _h_a_r_d _o_n _a _n_e_t_-

     --GG _s_w_e_e_p_m_a_x_s_i_z_e
             Specify the maximum size of ICMP payload when sending sweeping
             pings.  This option is required for ping sweeps.

     --gg _s_w_e_e_p_m_i_n_s_i_z_e
             Specify the size of ICMP payload to start with when sending
             sweeping pings.  The default value is 0.

     --hh _s_w_e_e_p_i_n_c_r_s_i_z_e
             Specify the number of bytes to increment the size of ICMP payload
             after each sweep when sending sweeping pings.  The default value
             is 1.

     --II _i_f_a_c_e
             Source multicast packets with the given interface address.  This
             flag only applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.

     --ii _w_a_i_t
             Wait _w_a_i_t seconds _b_e_t_w_e_e_n _s_e_n_d_i_n_g _e_a_c_h _p_a_c_k_e_t.  The default is to
             wait for one second between each packet.  The wait time may be
             fractional, but only the super-user may specify values less than
             0.1 second.  This option is incompatible with the --ff option.

     --kk _t_r_a_f_f_i_c_c_l_a_s_s
             Specifies the traffic class to use for sending ICMP packets.  The
             supported traffic classes are BK_SYS, BK, BE, RD, OAM, AV, RV,
             VI, VO and CTL.  By default ppiinngg uses the control traffic class
             (CTL).  This option is an Apple addition.

     --KK _n_e_t_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_t_y_p_e
             Specifies the network service type to use for sending ICMP pack-
             ets.  The supported network service type are BK_SYS, BK, BE, RV,
             AV, RD, OAM, VI, SIG and VO.  Note this overrides the default
             traffic class (-k can still be specified after -K to use both).
             This option is an Apple addition.

     --LL      Suppress loopback of multicast packets.  This flag only applies
             if the ping destination is a multicast address.

     --ll _p_r_e_l_o_a_d
             If _p_r_e_l_o_a_d is specified, ppiinngg sends that many packets as fast as
             possible before falling into its normal mode of behavior.  Only
             the super-user may use this option.

     --MM mmaasskk | ttiimmee
             Use ICMP_MASKREQ or ICMP_TSTAMP instead of ICMP_ECHO.  For mmaasskk,
             print the netmask of the remote machine.  Set the
             _n_e_t_._i_n_e_t_._i_c_m_p_._m_a_s_k_r_e_p_l MIB variable to enable ICMP_MASKREPLY.
             For ttiimmee, print the origination, reception and transmission time-
             stamps.

     --mm _t_t_l  Set the IP Time To Live for outgoing packets.  If not specified,
             the kernel uses the value of the _n_e_t_._i_n_e_t_._i_p_._t_t_l MIB variable.

     --nn      Numeric output only.  No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic
             names for host addresses.

     --oo      Exit successfully after receiving one reply packet.

     --PP _p_o_l_i_c_y
             _p_o_l_i_c_y specifies IPsec policy for the ping session.  For details
             please refer to ipsec(4) and ipsec_set_policy(3).

     --pp _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             You may specify up to 16 ``pad'' bytes to fill out the packet you
             send.  This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a
             network.  For example, ``-p ff'' will cause the sent packet to be
             filled with all ones.

     --QQ      Somewhat quiet output.  Don't display ICMP error messages that
             are in response to our query messages.  Originally, the --vv flag
             was required to display such errors, but --vv displays all ICMP
             error messages.  On a busy machine, this output can be overbear-
             ing.  Without the --QQ flag, ppiinngg prints out any ICMP error mes-
             sages caused by its own ECHO_REQUEST messages.

     --qq      Quiet output.  Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at
             startup time and when finished.

     --RR      Record route.  Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the
             ECHO_REQUEST packet and displays the route buffer on returned
             packets.  Note that the IP header is only large enough for nine
             such routes; the traceroute(8) command is usually better at
             determining the route packets take to a particular destination.
             If more routes come back than should, such as due to an illegal
             spoofed packet, ping will print the route list and then truncate
             it at the correct spot.  Many hosts ignore or discard the
             RECORD_ROUTE option.

     --rr      Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on
             an attached network.  If the host is not on a directly-attached
             network, an error is returned.  This option can be used to ping a
             local host through an interface that has no route through it
             (e.g., after the interface was dropped by routed(8)).

     --SS _s_r_c___a_d_d_r
             Use the following IP address as the source address in outgoing
             packets.  On hosts with more than one IP address, this option can
             be used to force the source address to be something other than
             the IP address of the interface the probe packet is sent on.  If
             the IP address is not one of this machine's interface addresses,
             an error is returned and nothing is sent.

     --ss _p_a_c_k_e_t_s_i_z_e
             Specify the number of data bytes to be sent.  The default is 56,
             which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8
             bytes of ICMP header data.  This option cannot be used with ping
             sweeps.

     --TT _t_t_l  Set the IP Time To Live for multicasted packets.  This flag only
             applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.

     --tt _t_i_m_e_o_u_t
             Specify a timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of
             how many packets have been received.

     --vv      Verbose output.  ICMP packets other than ECHO_RESPONSE that are
             received are listed.

     --WW _w_a_i_t_t_i_m_e
             Time in milliseconds to wait for a reply for each packet sent.
             If a reply arrives later, the packet is not printed as replied,
             but considered as replied when calculating statistics.

     --zz _t_o_s  Use the specified type of service.

     ----aappppllee--ccoonnnneecctt
             Connects the socket to the destination address.  This option is
             an Apple addition.

     ----aappppllee--ttiimmee
             Prints the time a packet was received.  This option is an Apple
             addition.

     When using ppiinngg for fault isolation, it should first be run on the local
     host, to verify that the local network interface is up and running.
     Then, hosts and gateways further and further away should be ``pinged''.
     Round-trip times and packet loss statistics are computed.  If duplicate
     packets are received, they are not included in the packet loss calcula-
     tion, although the round trip time of these packets is used in calculat-
     ing the round-trip time statistics.  When the specified number of packets
     have been sent (and received) or if the program is terminated with a
     SIGINT, a brief summary is displayed, showing the number of packets sent
     and received, and the minimum, mean, maximum, and standard deviation of
     the round-trip times.

     If ppiinngg receives a SIGINFO (see the ssttaattuuss argument for stty(1)) signal,
     the current number of packets sent and received, and the minimum, mean,
     and maximum of the round-trip times will be written to the standard error
     output.

     This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and man-
     agement.  Because of the load it can impose on the network, it is unwise
     to use ppiinngg during normal operations or from automated scripts.

IICCMMPP PPAACCKKEETT DDEETTAAIILLSS
     An IP header without options is 20 bytes.  An ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packet
     contains an additional 8 bytes worth of ICMP header followed by an arbi-
     trary amount of data.  When a _p_a_c_k_e_t_s_i_z_e is given, this indicated the
     size of this extra piece of data (the default is 56).  Thus the amount of
     data received inside of an IP packet of type ICMP ECHO_REPLY will always
     be 8 bytes more than the requested data space (the ICMP header).

     If the data space is at least eight bytes large, ppiinngg uses the first
     eight bytes of this space to include a timestamp which it uses in the
     computation of round trip times.  If less than eight bytes of pad are
     specified, no round trip times are given.

     The ppiinngg utility will report duplicate and damaged packets.  Duplicate
     packets should never occur when pinging a unicast address, and seem to be
     caused by inappropriate link-level retransmissions.  Duplicates may occur
     in many situations and are rarely (if ever) a good sign, although the
     presence of low levels of duplicates may not always be cause for alarm.
     Duplicates are expected when pinging a broadcast or multicast address,
     since they are not really duplicates but replies from different hosts to
     the same request.

     Damaged packets are obviously serious cause for alarm and often indicate
     broken hardware somewhere in the ppiinngg packet's path (in the network or in
     the hosts).

     The (inter)network layer should never treat packets differently depending
     on the data contained in the data portion.  Unfortunately, data-dependent
     problems have been known to sneak into networks and remain undetected for
     long periods of time.  In many cases the particular pattern that will
     have problems is something that does not have sufficient ``transitions'',
     such as all ones or all zeros, or a pattern right at the edge, such as
     almost all zeros.  It is not necessarily enough to specify a data pattern
     of all zeros (for example) on the command line because the pattern that
     is of interest is at the data link level, and the relationship between
     what you type and what the controllers transmit can be complicated.

     This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you will probably
     have to do a lot of testing to find it.  If you are lucky, you may manage
     to find a file that either cannot be sent across your network or that
     takes much longer to transfer than other similar length files.  You can
     then examine this file for repeated patterns that you can test using the
     --pp option of ppiinngg.

TTTTLL DDEETTAAIILLSS
     The TTL value of an IP packet represents the maximum number of IP routers
     that the packet can go through before being thrown away.  In current
     practice you can expect each router in the Internet to decrement the TTL
     field by exactly one.

     The TCP/IP specification recommends setting the TTL field for IP packets
     to 64, but many systems use smaller values (4.3BSD uses 30, 4.2BSD used
     15).

     The maximum possible value of this field is 255, and most UNIX systems
     set the TTL field of ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to 255.  This is why you
     will find you can ``ping'' some hosts, but not reach them with telnet(1)
     or ftp(1).

     In normal operation ppiinngg prints the ttl value from the packet it
     receives.  When a remote system receives a ping packet, it can do one of
     three things with the TTL field in its response:

     ++oo   Not change it; this is what BSD systems did before the 4.3BSD-Tahoe
         release.  In this case the TTL value in the received packet will be
         255 minus the number of routers in the round-trip path.

     ++oo   Set it to 255; this is what current BSD systems do.  In this case the
         TTL value in the received packet will be 255 minus the number of
         routers in the path _f_r_o_m the remote system _t_o the ppiinngg_i_n_g host.

     ++oo   Set it to some other value.  Some machines use the same value for
         ICMP packets that they use for TCP packets, for example either 30 or
         60.  Others may use completely wild values.

     The ppiinngg utility exits with one of the following values:

     Many Hosts and Gateways ignore the RECORD_ROUTE option.

     The maximum IP header length is too small for options like RECORD_ROUTE
     to be completely useful.  There's not much that can be done about this,
     however.

     Flood pinging is not recommended in general, and flood pinging the broad-
     cast address should only be done under very controlled conditions.

     The --vv option is not worth much on busy hosts.

launchctl,"# launchctl

> A command-line interface to Apple's `launchd` manager for launch daemons (system-wide services) and launch agents (per-user programs).
> `launchd` loads XML-based `*.plist` files placed in the appropriate locations, and runs the corresponding commands according to their defined schedule.

- Activate a user-specific agent to be loaded into `launchd` whenever the user logs in:

`launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/{{my_script}}.plist`

- Activate an agent which requires root privileges to run and/or should be loaded whenever any user logs in (note the absence of `~` in the path):

`sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/{{root_script}}.plist`

- Activate a system-wide daemon to be loaded whenever the system boots up (even if no user logs in):

`sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/{{system_daemon}}.plist`

- Show all loaded agents/daemons, with the PID if the process they specify is currently running, and the exit code returned the last time they ran:

`launchctl list`

- Unload a currently loaded agent, e.g. to make changes (note: the plist file is automatically loaded into `launchd` after a reboot and/or logging in):

`launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/{{my_script}}.plist`

- Manually run a known (loaded) agent/daemon, even if it is not the right time (note: this command uses the agent's label, rather than the filename):

`launchctl start {{my_script}}`

- Manually kill the process associated with a known agent/daemon, if it is running:

`launchctl stop {{my_script}}`

     llaauunncchhccttll allows for detailed examination of llaauunncchhdd endpoints. A domain
     manages the execution policy for a collection of services.  A service may
     be thought of as a virtual process that is always available to be spawned
     in response to demand. Each service has a collection of endpoints, and
     sending a message to one of those endpoints will cause the service to
     launch on demand. Domains advertise these endpoints in a shared namespace
     and may be thought of as synonymous with Mach bootstrap subsets.

     Many subcommands in llaauunncchhccttll take a specifier which indicates the target
     domain or service for the subcommand. This specifier may take one of the
     following forms:

     _s_y_s_t_e_m_/_[_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_-_n_a_m_e_]
              Targets the system domain or a service within the system domain.
              The system domain manages the root Mach bootstrap and is consid-
              ered a privileged execution context. Anyone may read or query
              the system domain, but root privileges are required to make mod-
              ifications.

     _u_s_e_r_/_<_u_i_d_>_/_[_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_-_n_a_m_e_]
              Targets the user domain for the given UID or a service within
              that domain. A user domain may exist independently of a logged-
              in user. User domains do not exist on iOS.

     _l_o_g_i_n_/_<_a_s_i_d_>_/_[_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_-_n_a_m_e_]
              Targets a user-login domain or service within that domain. A
              user-login domain is created when the user logs in at the GUI
              and is identified by the audit session identifier associated
              with that login. If a user domain has an associated login
              domain, the pprriinntt subcommand will display the ASID of that login
              domain. User-login domains do not exist on iOS.

     _g_u_i_/_<_u_i_d_>_/_[_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_-_n_a_m_e_]
              Another form of the llooggiinn specifier. Rather than specifying a
              user-login domain by its ASID, this specifier targets the domain
              based on which user it is associated with and is generally more
              convenient.

              _N_o_t_e: GUI domains and user domains share many resources. For the
              purposes of the Mach bootstrap name lookups, they are ""flat"", so
              they share the same set of registered names. But they still have
              discrete sets of services. So when printing the user domain's
              contents, you may see many Mach bootstrap name registrations
              from services that exist in the GUI domain for that user, but
              you will not see the services themselves in that list.

     _s_e_s_s_i_o_n_/_<_a_s_i_d_>_/_[_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_-_n_a_m_e_]
              Targets the session domain for the given audit session ID or a
              service within that domain. For more information about audit
              sessions, see auditon(2) and libbsm(3)

     _p_i_d_/_<_p_i_d_>_/_[_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_-_n_a_m_e_]
              Targets the domain for the given PID or a service within that
              domain. Each process on the system will have a PID domain asso-
              ciated with it that consists of the XPC services visible to that
              process which can be reached with xpc_connection_create(3).

     For instance, when referring to a service with the identifier
     ccoomm..aappppllee..eexxaammppllee loaded into the GUI domain of a user with UID 501,

              Bootstraps or removes domains and services. When service argu-
              ments are present, bootstraps and correspondingly removes their
              definitions into the domain.  Services may be specified as a
              series of paths or a service identifier.  Paths may point to XPC
              service bundles, launchd.plist(5) s, or a directories containing
              a collection of either. If there were one or more errors while
              bootstrapping or removing a collection of services, the problem-
              atic paths will be printed with the errors that occurred.

              If no paths or service target are specified, these commands can
              either bootstrap or remove a domain specified as a domain tar-
              get. Some domains will implicitly bootstrap pre-defined paths as
              part of their creation.

              Enables or disables the service in the requested domain. Once a
              service is disabled, it cannot be loaded in the specified domain
              until it is once again enabled. This state persists across boots
              of the device. This subcommand may only target services within
              the system domain or user and user-login domains.

     _u_n_c_a_c_h_e _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_-_n_a_m_e
              This subcommand instructs llaauunncchhdd to bypass its service cache
              for the named service and instead read the service's configura-
              tion file directly from disk.  llaauunncchhdd maintains an in-memory
              cache of XPC service configuration files to minimize the disk
              I/O. This subcommand will remove a cached entry so that develop-
              ers may more rapidly iterate on a service's configuration. It
              should not ever be used as part of production workflow.

              Configures the next invocation of a service for debugging. This
              subcommand allows you to temporarily replace the main executable
              of the service with one at a different path, enable
              libgmalloc(3), set environment variables, set the argument vec-
              tor and more. This is a convenient alternative to editing the
              launchd.plist(5) for the service and then reloading it, as the
              additional debugging properties are cleared once the service has
              run once with them.

              what names the ports are advertised as in the Mach bootstrap

              Given a PID and the name of a Mach port right in that process'
              port namespace, resolves that port to an endpoint name known to
              llaauunncchhdd.  This subcommand requires root privileges.

              Causes llaauunncchhdd to fork(2) itself for examination by a profiling
              tool and prints the PID of this new instance to stdout. You are
              responsible for killing this snapshot when it is no longer
              needed.

              Many profiling tools cannot safely examine llaauunncchhdd because they
              depend on the functionality it provides. This subcommand creates
              an effective snapshot of llaauunncchhdd that can be examined indepen-
              dently. Note that on Darwin platforms, fork(2) is implemented
              such that only the thread which called fork(2) is replicated
              into the new child process, so this subcommand is not useful for
              examining any thread other than the main event loop.

              This subcommand takes an optional invocation of a tool to be
              used on the llaauunncchhdd snapshot. Where you would normally give the
              PID of the process to be examined in the tool's invocation,
              instead specify the argument ""@PID"", and llaauunncchhccttll will substi-
              tute that argument with the PID of the launchd snapshot in its
              subsequent execution of the tool. If used in this form,
              llaauunncchhccttll will automatically kill the snapshot instance when the
              examination tool exits.

              This subcommand may only be used against a DEVELOPMENT llaauunncchhdd.

              Sets persistent configuration information for launchd(8)
              domains. Only the system domain and user domains may be config-
              ured. The location of the persistent storage is an implementa-
              tion detail, and changes to that storage should _o_n_l_y be made
              through this subcommand. A reboot is required for changes made
              through this subcommand to take effect.

              Supported configuration parameters are:

              umask    Sets the umask(2) for services within the target domain
                       to the value specified by _v_a_l_u_e.  Note that this value
                       is parsed by strtoul(3) as an octal-encoded number, so
                       there is no need to prefix it with a leading '0'.

              path     Sets the PATH environment variable for all services
                       within the target domain to the string _v_a_l_u_e.  The
                       string _v_a_l_u_e should conform to the format outlined for
                       the PATH environment variable in environ(7).  Note that
                       if a service specifies its own PATH, the service-spe-
                       cific environment variable will take precedence.

                       ronment variables for all services within the domain.
                       It is intentionally scoped to the PATH environment
                       variable and nothing else for security reasons.

              Instructs llaauunncchhdd to begin tearing down userspace. With no argu-
              ment given or with the _s_y_s_t_e_m argument given, llaauunncchhdd will make
              the reboot(2) system call when userspace has been completely
              torn down. With the _h_a_l_t argument given, llaauunncchhdd will make the
              reboot(2) system call when userspace has been completely torn
              down and pass the _R_B___H_A_L_T flag, halting the system and not ini-
              tiating a reboot.

              With the _u_s_e_r_s_p_a_c_e argument given, llaauunncchhdd will re-exec itself
              when userspace has been torn down and bring userspace back up.
              This is useful for rebooting the system quickly under conditions
              where kernel data structures or hardware do not need to be re-
              initialized.

              With the _l_o_g_o_u_t argument given, launchd will tear down the
              caller's GUI login session in a manner similar to a logout ini-
              tiated from the Apple menu. The key difference is that a logout
              initiated through this subcommand will be much faster since it
              will not give apps a chance to display modal dialogs to block
              logout indefinitely; therefore there is data corruption risk to
              using this option. Only use it when you know you have no unsaved
              data in your running apps.

              With the _a_p_p_s argument given, launchd will terminate all apps
              running in the caller's GUI login session that did not come from
              a launchd.plist(5) on-disk. Apps like Finder, Dock and Syste-
              mUIServer will be unaffected. Apps are terminated in the same
              manner as the _l_o_g_o_u_t argument, and all the same caveats apply.

              --ss       When rebooting the machine (either a full reboot or
                       userspace reboot), brings the subsequent boot session
                       up in single-user mode.

              default, llaauunncchhccttll will attempt to guess which error domain the

              domain (either _p_o_s_i_x, _m_a_c_h, or _b_o_o_t_s_t_r_a_p) to interpret the given
              code as an error from that subsystem.

     _v_a_r_i_a_n_t  Prints the llaauunncchhdd variant currently active on the system. Pos-

     Subcommands from the previous implementation of llaauunncchhdd are generally
     available, though some may be unimplemented. Unimplemented subcommands
     are documented as such.

              Load the specified configuration files or directories of config-
              uration files.  Jobs that are not on-demand will be started as
              soon as possible. All specified jobs will be loaded before any
              of them are allowed to start. Note that per-user configuration
              files (LaunchAgents) must be owned by root (if they are located
              in //LLiibbrraarryy//LLaauunncchhAAggeennttss) or the user loading them (if they are
              located in $$HHOOMMEE//LLiibbrraarryy//LLaauunncchhAAggeennttss).  All system-wide daemons
              (LaunchDaemons) must be owned by root. Configuration files must
              disallow group and world writes. These restrictions are in place
              for security reasons, as allowing writability to a launchd con-
              figuration file allows one to specify which executable will be
              launched.

              Note that allowing non-root write access to the
              //SSyysstteemm//LLiibbrraarryy//LLaauunncchhDDaaeemmoonnss directory WILL render your system

              --ww       Overrides the Disabled key and sets it to false or true
                       for the load and unload subcommands respectively. In
                       previous versions, this option would modify the config-
                       uration file. Now the state of the Disabled key is
                       stored elsewhere on- disk in a location that may not be
                       directly manipulated by any process other than llaauunncchhdd.

              --FF       Force the loading or unloading of the plist. Ignore the
                       Disabled key.

              --SS _s_e_s_s_i_o_n_t_y_p_e
                       Some jobs only make sense in certain contexts. This
                       flag instructs llaauunncchhccttll to look for jobs in a differ-
                       ent location when using the -D flag, and allows
                       llaauunncchhccttll to restrict which jobs are loaded into which
                       session types. Sessions are only relevant for per-user
                       llaauunncchhdd contexts. Relevant sessions are Aqua (the
                       default), Background and LoginWindow.  Background
                       agents may be loaded independently of a GUI login. Aqua
                       agents are loaded only when a user has logged in at the
                       GUI. LoginWindow agents are loaded when the LoginWindow
                       UI is displaying and currently run as root.

              --DD _s_e_a_r_c_h_p_a_t_h
                       Load or unload all plist(5) files in the search path
                       given. This option may be thought of as expanding into
                       many individual paths depending on the search path
                       given. Valid search paths include ""system,"" ""local,""
                       and ""all."" When providing a session type, an additional
                       search path is available for use called ""user."" For
                       example, without a session type given, ""-D system""
                       would load from or unload all property list files from
                       //SSyysstteemm//LLiibbrraarryy//LLaauunncchhDDaaeemmoonnss.  With a session type
                       passed, it would load from
                       //SSyysstteemm//LLiibbrraarryy//LLaauunncchhAAggeennttss.  Note that llaauunncchhccttll no
                       longer respects the network search path.

                       In a previous version of launchd, these search paths
                       were called ""domains"", hence -D. The word ""domain"" is
                       now used for a totally different concept.

              _N_O_T_E: Due to bugs in the previous implementation and long-stand-
              ing client expectations around those bugs, the _l_o_a_d and _u_n_l_o_a_d
              subcommands will only return a non-zero exit code due to
              improper usage.  Otherwise, zero is always returned.

              A simple way of submitting a program to run without a configura-
              tion file. This mechanism also tells launchd to keep the program
              alive in the event of failure.

              --ll _l_a_b_e_l
                       What unique label to assign this job to launchd.

              --pp _p_r_o_g_r_a_m
                       What program to really execute, regardless of what fol-
                       lows the -- in the submit sub-command.

              --oo _s_t_d_o_u_t_-_p_a_t_h
                       Where to send the stdout of the program.

              --ee _s_t_d_e_r_r_-_p_a_t_h
                       Where to send the stderr of the program.

     _r_e_m_o_v_e _l_a_b_e_l
              Remove the job from launchd by label. This subcommand will
              return immediately and not block until the job has been stopped.

     _s_t_a_r_t _l_a_b_e_l
              Start the specified job by label. The expected use of this sub-
              command is for debugging and testing so that one can manually
              kick-start an on-demand server.

     _s_t_o_p _l_a_b_e_l
              Stop the specified job by label. If a job is on-demand, launchd
              may immediately restart the job if launchd finds any criteria
              that is satisfied.

     _l_i_s_t [_-_x] [_l_a_b_e_l]
              With no arguments, list all of the jobs loaded into llaauunncchhdd in
              three columns. The first column displays the PID of the job if
              it is running.  The second column displays the last exit status
              of the job. If the number in this column is negative, it repre-
              sents the negative of the signal which stopped the job. Thus,
              ""-15"" would indicate that the job was terminated with SIGTERM.
              The third column is the job's label. If [_l_a_b_e_l] is specified,
              prints information about the requested job.

              --xx       This flag is no longer supported.

     _s_e_t_e_n_v _k_e_y _v_a_l_u_e
              Specify an environment variable to be set on all future pro-
              cesses launched by llaauunncchhdd in the caller's context.

     _u_n_s_e_t_e_n_v _k_e_y
              Specify that an environment variable no longer be set on any
              future processes launched by llaauunncchhdd in the caller's context.

     _g_e_t_e_n_v _k_e_y
              Print the value of an environment variable that llaauunncchhdd would
              set for all processes launched into the caller's context.

     _e_x_p_o_r_t   Export all of the environment variables of llaauunncchhdd for use in a
              shell eval statement.

     _g_e_t_r_u_s_a_g_e _s_e_l_f | _c_h_i_l_d_r_e_n
              Get the resource utilization statistics for llaauunncchhdd or the chil-
              dren of llaauunncchhdd.  This subcommand is not implemented.

              Get and set the syslog(3) log level mask. The available log lev-
              els are: debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical, alert
              and emergency. This subcommand is not implemented.

              With no arguments, this command prints all the resource limits
              of llaauunncchhdd as found via getrlimit(2).  When a given resource is
              specified, it prints the limits for that resource. With a third
              argument, it sets both the hard and soft limits to that value.
              With four arguments, the third and forth argument represent the
              soft and hard limits respectively.  See setrlimit(2).

     _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n
              Tell llaauunncchhdd to prepare for shutdown by removing all jobs. This
              subcommand is not implemented.

     _u_m_a_s_k [_n_e_w_m_a_s_k]
              Get or optionally set the umask(2) of llaauunncchhdd.  This subcommand
              is not implemented.

     _b_s_l_i_s_t [_P_I_D | _._.] [_-_j]
              This subcommand is not implemented and has been superseded by
              the _p_r_i_n_t subcommand, which provides much richer information.

     _b_s_e_x_e_c _P_I_D _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g_s]
              This executes the given command in as similar an execution con-
              text as possible to the target PID. Adopted attributes include
              the Mach bootstrap namespace, exception server and security
              audit session. It does not modify the process' credentials (UID,
              GID, etc.) or adopt any environment variables from the target
              process. It affects only the Mach bootstrap context and
              directly-related attributes.

     _a_s_u_s_e_r _U_I_D _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g_s]
              This executes the given command in as similar an execution con-
              text as possible to that of the target user's bootstrap. Adopted
              attributes include the Mach bootstrap namespace, exception
              server and security audit session. It does not modify the
              process' credentials (UID, GID, etc.) or adopt any user-specific
              environment variables. It affects only the Mach bootstrap con-
              text and directly- related attributes.

     _b_s_t_r_e_e   This subcommand is not implemented and has been superseded by
              the _p_r_i_n_t subcommand, which provides much richer information.

     _m_a_n_a_g_e_r_p_i_d
              This prints the PID of the launchd which manages the current
              bootstrap. In prior implementations, there could be multiple
              llaauunncchhdd processes each managing their own Mach bootstrap sub-
              sets. In the current implementation, all bootstraps are managed
              by one process, so this subcommand will always print ""1"".

     _m_a_n_a_g_e_r_u_i_d
              This prints the UID associated with the caller's launchd con-
              text.

     _m_a_n_a_g_e_r_n_a_m_e
              This prints the name of the launchd job manager which manages
              the current launchd context. See LimitLoadToSessionType in
              launchd.plist(5) for more details.

     The output produced by the ""legacy"" subcommands (chiefly _l_i_s_t) should
     match their output on previous OS X releases. However, the output of
     newer subcommands does not conform to any particular format and is not
     guaranteed to remain stable across releases. These commands are intended
     for use by human developers and system administrators, not for automation
     by programs or scripts. Their output does not constitute an API and no
     promises of forward compatibility are offered to programs that attempt to
     parse it.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The mmdd55 utility takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces
     as output a ``fingerprint'' or ``message digest'' of the input.  It is
     conjectured that it is computationally infeasible to produce two messages
     having the same message digest, or to produce any message having a given
     prespecified target message digest.  The MD5 algorithm is intended for
     digital signature applications, where a large file must be ``compressed''
     in a secure manner before being encrypted with a private (secret) key
     under a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA.

     MD5's designer Ron Rivest has stated ""md5 and sha1 are both clearly bro-
     ken (in terms of collision-resistance)"".  So MD5 should be avoided when
     creating new protocols, or implementing protocols with better options.
     SHA256 and SHA512 are better options as they have been more resilient to
     attacks (as of 2009).

     The following options may be used in any combination and must precede any
     files named on the command line.  The hexadecimal checksum of each file
     listed on the command line is printed after the options are processed.

     --ss _s_t_r_i_n_g
             Print a checksum of the given _s_t_r_i_n_g.

     --qq      Quiet mode - only the checksum is printed out.  Overrides the --rr
             option.

     --rr      Reverses the format of the output.  This helps with visual diffs.
             Does nothing when combined with the --ppttxx options.

       For the full command list, see the _C_O_M_M_A_N_D_S section.

       With ----vveerrbboossee or ----ddeebbuugg, many commands print extra debugging informa-
       tion. Note that these options should only appear after a command.

   iinnssttaallll _f_o_r_m_u_l_a:
       Install _f_o_r_m_u_l_a.

       _f_o_r_m_u_l_a is usually the name of the formula to install, but it has other
       syntaxes which are listed in the _S_P_E_C_I_F_Y_I_N_G _F_O_R_M_U_L_A_E section.

   uunniinnssttaallll _f_o_r_m_u_l_a:
       Uninstall _f_o_r_m_u_l_a.

   lliisstt:
       List all installed formulae.

   sseeaarrcchh (_t_e_x_t|//_t_e_x_t//):
       Perform a substring search of cask tokens and formula names  for  _t_e_x_t.
       If  _t_e_x_t  is flanked by slashes, it is interpreted as a regular expres-
       sion. The search for _t_e_x_t is extended online to hhoommeebbrreeww//ccoorree and hhoommee--

              Fetch the upstream repository to detect if the HEAD installation
              of  the  formula  is  outdated. Otherwise, the repository's HEAD
              will only be checked for updates when a new stable  or  develop-

       Tap a formula repository.

       If no arguments are provided, list all installed taps.

       With _U_R_L unspecified, tap a formula repository from GitHub using HTTPS.
       Since so many taps are hosted on GitHub, this command is a shortcut for
       bbrreeww ttaapp _u_s_e_r//_r_e_p_o hhttttppss::////ggiitthhuubb..ccoomm//_u_s_e_r//hhoommeebbrreeww--_r_e_p_o.

       With  _U_R_L  specified, tap a formula repository from anywhere, using any
       transport protocol that ggiitt(1) handles. The one-argument  form  of  ttaapp
       simplifies  but also limits. This two-argument command makes no assump-
       tions, so taps can be cloned from places other than  GitHub  and  using
       protocols other than HTTPS, e.g. SSH, git, HTTP, FTP(S), rsync.

       ----ffuullll Convert  a shallow clone to a full clone without untapping. Taps
              are only cloned as shallow clones on continuous integration,  or
              if ----sshhaallllooww was originally passed.

       ----sshhaallllooww
              Fetch  tap  as  a shallow clone rather than a full clone. Useful

              Auto-update tap even if it is not hosted on GitHub. By  default,
              only  taps  hosted  on  GitHub are auto-updated (for performance
              reasons).

       ----rreeppaaiirr

       Bundler for non-Ruby dependencies from Homebrew, Homebrew Cask, Mac App
       Store and Whalebrew.

       bbrreeww bbuunnddllee [iinnssttaallll]
           Install and upgrade (by default) all dependencies  from  the  BBrreeww--
       ffiillee.

       You can skip the installation of dependencies by adding space-separated
       values to one or more of the  following  environment  variables:  HHOOMMEE--
       BBRREEWW__BBUUNNDDLLEE__BBRREEWW__SSKKIIPP,     HHOOMMEEBBRREEWW__BBUUNNDDLLEE__CCAASSKK__SSKKIIPP,     HHOOMMEEBBRREEWW__BBUUNN--

       bbrreeww bbuunnddllee will output a BBrreewwffiillee..lloocckk..jjssoonn in the same  directory  as
       the  BBrreewwffiillee if all dependencies are installed successfully. This con-
       tains dependency and system status information which can be  useful  in
       debugging  bbrreeww  bbuunnddllee  failures  and  replicating  a ""last known good
       build"" state. You can opt-out of this behaviour by  setting  the  HHOOMMEE--
       BBRREEWW__BBUUNNDDLLEE__NNOO__LLOOCCKK  environment  variable  or  passing  the  ----nnoo--lloocckk
       option. You may wish to check this file into the same  version  control
       system  as your BBrreewwffiillee (or ensure your version control system ignores
       it if you'd prefer to  rely  on  debugging  information  from  a  local
       machine).

           Uninstall all dependencies not listed from the BBrreewwffiillee.

       This  workflow  is  useful  for  maintainers  or  testers who regularly
       install lots of formulae.

       bbrreeww bbuunnddllee cchheecckk
           Check if all dependencies are installed from the BBrreewwffiillee .

       This provides a successful exit code if everything is up-to-date,  mak-
       ing it useful for scripting.

       bbrreeww bbuunnddllee lliisstt
           List all dependencies present in a BBrreewwffiillee.

           Run  an  external command in an isolated build environment based on
       the BBrreewwffiillee dependencies.

       This sanitized  build  environment  ignores  unrequested  dependencies,
       which  makes sure that things you didn't specify in your BBrreewwffiillee won't
       get picked up by commands like bbuunnddllee iinnssttaallll,  nnppmm  iinnssttaallll,  etc.  It
       will also add compiler flags which will help find keg-only dependencies
       like ooppeennssssll, iiccuu44cc, etc.

       Homebrew, like ggiitt(1), supports external commands. These are executable
       scripts  that  reside  somewhere  in  the  PPAATTHH,  named bbrreeww--_c_m_d_n_a_m_e or
       bbrreeww--_c_m_d_n_a_m_e..rrbb, which can be invoked like bbrreeww  _c_m_d_n_a_m_e.  This  allows
       you to create your own commands without modifying Homebrew's internals.

       Instructions for creating your own commands can be found in  the  docs:
       _h_t_t_p_s_:_/_/_d_o_c_s_._b_r_e_w_._s_h_/_E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l_-_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s

SSPPEECCIIFFYYIINNGG FFOORRMMUULLAAEE
       Many  Homebrew  commands  accept  one  or more _f_o_r_m_u_l_a arguments. These
       arguments can take several different forms:

       The name of a formula
              e.g. ggiitt, nnooddee, wwggeett.

       The fully-qualified name of a tapped formula
              Sometimes a formula from a tapped repository may  conflict  with
              one  in  hhoommeebbrreeww//ccoorree.  You  can still access these formulae by
              using a special syntax, e.g. hhoommeebbrreeww//dduuppeess//vviimm or hhoommeebbrreeww//vveerr--
              ssiioonnss//nnooddee44.

       An arbitrary file
              Homebrew can install formulae from a local path. It can point to
              either a formula file or a bottle.

       Many Homebrew Cask commands accept one or more  _c_a_s_k  arguments.  These
       can  be  specified  the  same way as the _f_o_r_m_u_l_a arguments described in
       SSPPEECCIIFFYYIINNGG FFOORRMMUULLAAEE above.

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

> Check the integrity of a filesystem or repair it. The filesystem should be unmounted at the time the command is run.
> It is a wrapper that calls `fsck_hfs`, `fsck_apfs`, `fsck_msdos`, `fsck_exfat`, and `fsck_udf` as needed.

- Check filesystem /dev/sda, reporting any damaged blocks:

`fsck {{/dev/sda}}`

- Check filesystem /dev/sda only if it is clean, reporting any damaged blocks and interactively letting the user choose to repair each one:

`fsck -f {{/dev/sda}}`

- Check filesystem /dev/sda only if it is clean, reporting any damaged blocks and automatically repairing them:

`fsck -fy {{/dev/sda}}`

- Check filesystem /dev/sda, reporting whether it has been cleanly unmounted:

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The first form of ffsscckk preens a standard set of filesystems or the speci-
     fied filesystems.  It is normally used in the script _/_e_t_c_/_r_c during auto-
     matic reboot.  Here ffsscckk reads the filesystem descriptor table (using
     getfsent(3)) to determine which filesystems to check.  Only partitions
     that have ``rw,'' ``rq'' or ``ro'' as options, and that have non-zero
     pass number are checked.  Filesystems with pass number 1 (normally just
     the root filesystem) are checked one at a time.  When pass 1 completes,
     all remaining filesystems are checked, running one process per disk
     drive.  The disk drive containing each filesystem is inferred from the
     shortest prefix of the device name that ends in one or more digits; the
     remaining characters are assumed to be the partition designator.  In
     preening mode, filesystems that are marked clean are skipped.  Filesys-
     tems are marked clean when they are unmounted, when they have been
     mounted read-only, or when ffsscckk runs on them successfully.

     It should be noted that ffsscckk is now essentially a wrapper that invokes
     other _f_s_c_k___X_X_X utilities as needed.  Currently, ffsscckk can invoke _f_s_c_k___h_f_s,
     _f_s_c_k___a_p_f_s, _f_s_c_k___m_s_d_o_s, _f_s_c_k___e_x_f_a_t, and _f_s_c_k___u_d_f.  If this underlying
     process that ffsscckk invokes encounters serious inconsistencies or the
     filesystem type is not one of the above, it exits with an abnormal return
     status and an automatic reboot will then fail.  For each corrected incon-
     sistency one or more lines will be printed identifying the filesystem on
     which the correction will take place, and the nature of the correction.

     If sent a QUIT signal, ffsscckk will finish the filesystem checks, then exit
     with an abnormal return status that causes an automatic reboot to fail.
     This is useful when you want to finish the filesystem checks during an
     automatic reboot, but do not want the machine to come up multiuser after
     the checks complete.

     Without the --pp option, ffsscckk audits and interactively repairs inconsistent
     conditions for filesystems.  It should be noted that some of the correc-
     tive actions which are not correctable under the --pp option will result in
     some loss of data.  The amount and severity of data lost may be deter-
     mined from the diagnostic output.  If the operator does not have write
     permission on the filesystem ffsscckk will default to a --nn action.

     The following flags are interpreted by ffsscckk and passed along to the
     underlying tool that it spawns.

     --ff          Force fsck to check `clean' filesystems when preening.

     --ll          Limit the number of parallel checks to the number specified
                 in the following argument.  By default, the limit is the num-
                 ber of disks, running one process per disk.  If a smaller
                 limit is given, the disks are checked round-robin, one
                 filesystem at a time.

     --RR          Specify a particular passno number for which fsck is to
                 check.  You may only specify 1 or 2.  Only those filesystems
                 matching that particular passno entry (if using fstab) will
                 be checked.  For more information on the passno field, see
                 fstab(5).

     --pp          ""Preen"" mode, described above.

     --qq          Do a quick check to determine if the filesystem was unmounted
                 cleanly.

     --yy          Assume a yes response to all questions asked by ffsscckk; this
                 should be used with great caution as this is a free license
                 to continue after essentially unlimited trouble has been
                 encountered.

     --nn          Assume a no response to all questions asked by ffsscckk except
                 for `CONTINUE?', which is assumed to be affirmative; do not
                 open the filesystem for writing.

     If no filesystems are given to ffsscckk then a default list of filesystems is
     read using getfsent(3).

     Because of inconsistencies between the block device and the buffer cache,
     the raw device should always be used.

     The ssyyssccttll utility retrieves kernel state and allows processes with
     appropriate privilege to set kernel state.  The state to be retrieved or
     set is described using a ``Management Information Base'' (``MIB'') style
     name, described as a dotted set of components.

     The following options are available:

     --AA      Equivalent to --oo --aa (for compatibility).

     --aa      List all the currently available non-opaque values.  This option
             is ignored if one or more variable names are specified on the
             command line.

     --bb      Force the value of the variable(s) to be output in raw, binary
             format.  No names are printed and no terminating newlines are
             output.  This is mostly useful with a single variable.

     --dd      Print the description of the variable instead of its value.

     --ee      Separate the name and the value of the variable(s) with `='.
             This is useful for producing output which can be fed back to the
             ssyyssccttll utility.  This option is ignored if either --NN or --nn is
             specified, or a variable is being set.

     --hh      Format output for human, rather than machine, readability.

     --ii      Ignore unknown OIDs.  The purpose is to make use of ssyyssccttll for
             collecting data from a variety of machines (not all of which are
             necessarily running exactly the same software) easier.

     --NN      Show only variable names, not their values.  This is particularly
             useful with shells that offer programmable completion.  To enable
             completion of variable names in zsh(1) (_p_o_r_t_s_/_s_h_e_l_l_s_/_z_s_h), use
             the following code:

                   listsysctls () { set -A reply $(sysctl -AN ${1%.*}) }
                   compctl -K listsysctls sysctl

             To enable completion of variable names in tcsh(1), use:

                   complete sysctl 'n/*/`sysctl -Na`/'

     --nn      Show only variable values, not their names.  This option is use-
             ful for setting shell variables.  For instance, to save the page-
             size in variable _p_s_i_z_e, use:

                   set psize=`sysctl -n hw.pagesize`

     --oo      Show opaque variables (which are normally suppressed).  The for-
             mat and length are printed, as well as a hex dump of the first
             sixteen bytes of the value.

     --qq      Suppress some warnings generated by ssyyssccttll to standard error.

     --XX      Equivalent to --xx --aa (for compatibility).

     --xx      As --oo, but prints a hex dump of the entire value instead of just
             the first few bytes.

     The information available from ssyyssccttll consists of integers, strings, and
     opaque types.  The ssyyssccttll utility only knows about a couple of opaque
     types, and will resort to hexdumps for the rest.  The opaque information
     is much more useful if retrieved by special purpose programs such as
     ps(1), systat(1), and netstat(1).

     The string and integer information is summarized below.  For a detailed
     description of these variable see sysctl(3).

     The changeable column indicates whether a process with appropriate privi-
     lege can change the value.  String and integer values can be set using
     ssyyssccttll.

     Invoked with no options, ssccuuttiill provides a command line interface to the
     ""dynamic store"" data maintained by configd(8).  Interaction with this
     data (using the SystemConfiguration.framework SCDynamicStore APIs) is
     handled with a set of commands read from standard input.  A list of the
     available commands is available by entering the _h_e_l_p directive.

     The ----pprreeffss option provides a command line interface to the [raw] stored
     preference data.  Interaction with this data (using the SystemConfigura-
     tion.framework SCPreferences APIs) is handled with a set of commands read
     from standard input.  A list of the available commands is availble by
     entering the _h_e_l_p directive.

     The --rr option provides a means of checking the network reachability of a
     host, an IP address, or a pair of local and remote IP addresses.  Network
     ""reachability"" is a term that indicates whether network communication is
     possible between the current host and the specified host.

     The --ww option provides a means of checking for (and optionally waiting
     for the creation of or posting of a notification to) a dynamic store key.

     The ----ggeett and ----sseett options provide a means of reporting and updating a
     select group of persistent system preferences.

     The ----ddnnss option reports the current DNS configuration.  The first listed
     resolver(5) configuration is considered to be the ""default"" configura-
     tion.  Additional ""supplemental"" configurations follow.  Those containing
     a ""domain"" name will be used for queries matching the specified domain.
     Those without will be used as a ""default"" configuration in addition to
     the first listed.

     The ----pprrooxxyy option reports the current system proxy configuration.

     The ----nncc option provides a set of commands for monitoring and interacting
     with VPN connections.  Use ----nncc _h_e_l_p for a full list of commands.

         Check the network reachability of the specified host name, IP
         address, or a pair of local and remote IP addresses.  One or more of
         the following strings will be reported to standard output.

         Not Reachable         The specified nodename/address cannot be
                               reached using the current network configura-
                               tion.

         Reachable             The specified nodename/address can be reached
                               using the current network configuration.

         Transient Connection  The specified nodename/address can be reached
                               via a transient (e.g. PPP) connection.

         Connection Required   The specified nodename/address can be reached
                               using the current network configuration but a
                               connection must first be established.  As an
                               example, this status would be returned for a
                               dialup connection that was not currently active
                               but could handle network traffic for the target
                               system.

         Connection Automatic  The specified nodename/address can be reached
                               using the current network configuration but a
                               connection must first be established.  Any
                               traffic directed to the specified name/address
                               will initiate the connection.

         Local Address         The specified nodename/address is one associ-
                               ated with a network interface on the system.

         Directly Reachable Addresss
                               Network traffic to the specified node-
                               name/address will not go through a gateway but
                               is routed directly to one of the interfaces on
                               the system.

         The reachability can also be monitored by specifying the --WW (watch)
         option.  This will result in the current status being reported as
         well as the status when/if the network configuration changes.

         A zero exit status will be returned when the reachability status is
         reported correctly.  A non-zero exit status will be returned if
         errors are detected with an error reported to standard error.

     --ww _d_y_n_a_m_i_c_-_s_t_o_r_e_-_k_e_y [--tt _t_i_m_e_o_u_t]
         Check if the specified key exists in the ""dynamic store"" data main-
         tained by configd(8).  If present, ssccuuttiill will return with a zero
         exit status.  If not present, ssccuuttiill will wait for the specified time
         for data to be associated with or a notification to be posted using
         the key.  A non-zero exit status will be returned if the key was not
         created/posted within the specified time.

         ssccuuttiill will wait indefinitely if a timeout of 0 seconds is specified.
         The default timeout is 15 seconds.

     ----ggeett _p_r_e_f
         Retrieves the specified preference.  The current value will be
         reported on standard output.

         Supported preferences include:

               ComputerName   The user-friendly name for the system.

               LocalHostName  The local (Bonjour) host name.

               HostName       The name associated with hostname(1) and
                              gethostname(3).

     ----sseett _p_r_e_f [_n_e_w_v_a_l]
         Updates the specified preference with the new value.  If the new
         value is not specified on the command line then it will be read from
         standard input.

         Supported preferences include: ComputerName LocalHostName HostName

             enclosed in ``|'' characters.

     --ee _f_o_r_m_a_t___s_t_r_i_n_g
             Specify a format string to be used for displaying data.

     --ff _f_o_r_m_a_t___f_i_l_e
             Specify a file that contains one or more newline separated format
             strings.  Empty lines and lines whose first non-blank character
             is a hash mark (##) are ignored.

     --nn _l_e_n_g_t_h
             Interpret only _l_e_n_g_t_h bytes of input.

     --oo      _T_w_o_-_b_y_t_e _o_c_t_a_l _d_i_s_p_l_a_y.  Display the input offset in hexadecimal,
             followed by eight space-separated, six column, zero-filled, two
             byte quantities of input data, in octal, per line.

     --ss _o_f_f_s_e_t
             Skip _o_f_f_s_e_t bytes from the beginning of the input.  By default,
             _o_f_f_s_e_t is interpreted as a decimal number.  With a leading 00xx or
             00XX, _o_f_f_s_e_t is interpreted as a hexadecimal number, otherwise,
             with a leading 00, _o_f_f_s_e_t is interpreted as an octal number.
             Appending the character bb, kk, mm, or gg to _o_f_f_s_e_t causes it to be
             interpreted as a multiple of 512, 1024, 1048576, or 1073741824,
             respectively.

     --vv      Cause hheexxdduummpp to display all input data.  Without the --vv option,
             any number of groups of output lines, which would be identical to
             the immediately preceding group of output lines (except for the
             input offsets), are replaced with a line comprised of a single
             asterisk.

     --xx      _T_w_o_-_b_y_t_e _h_e_x_a_d_e_c_i_m_a_l _d_i_s_p_l_a_y.  Display the input offset in hexa-
             decimal, followed by eight, space separated, four column, zero-
             filled, two-byte quantities of input data, in hexadecimal, per
             line.

     For each input file, hheexxdduummpp sequentially copies the input to standard
     output, transforming the data according to the format strings specified
     by the --ee and --ff options, in the order that they were specified.

   FFoorrmmaattss
     A format string contains any number of format units, separated by white-
     space.  A format unit contains up to three items: an iteration count, a
     byte count, and a format.

     The iteration count is an optional positive integer, which defaults to
     one.  Each format is applied iteration count times.

     The byte count is an optional positive integer.  If specified it defines
     the number of bytes to be interpreted by each iteration of the format.

     If an iteration count and/or a byte count is specified, a single slash
     must be placed after the iteration count and/or before the byte count to
     disambiguate them.  Any whitespace before or after the slash is ignored.

     The format is required and must be surrounded by double quote ("" "")
     marks.  It is interpreted as a fprintf-style format string (see
     fprintf(3)), with the following exceptions:

           ++oo   An asterisk (*) may not be used as a field width or precision.

           ++oo   A byte count or field precision _i_s required for each ``s'' con-
               version character (unlike the fprintf(3) default which prints
               the entire string if the precision is unspecified).

           ++oo   The conversion characters ``h'', ``l'', ``n'', ``p'' and ``q''
               are not supported.

           ++oo   The single character escape sequences described in the C stan-
               dard are supported:

                     NUL                  \0
                     <alert character>    \a
                     <backspace>          \b
                     <form-feed>          \f
                     <newline>            \n
                     <carriage return>    \r
                     <tab>                \t
                     <vertical tab>       \v

     The hheexxdduummpp utility also supports the following additional conversion
     strings:

     __aa[ddooxx]     Display the input offset, cumulative across input files, of
                 the next byte to be displayed.  The appended characters dd, oo,
                 and xx specify the display base as decimal, octal or hexadeci-
                 mal respectively.

     __AA[ddooxx]     Identical to the __aa conversion string except that it is only
                 performed once, when all of the input data has been pro-
                 cessed.

     __cc          Output characters in the default character set.  Nonprinting
                 characters are displayed in three character, zero-padded
                 octal, except for those representable by standard escape
                 notation (see above), which are displayed as two character
                 strings.

     __pp          Output characters in the ASCII character set.  Non-ASCII
                 characters are displayed as a single ``..''.

     __uu          Output US ASCII characters, with the exception that control
                 characters are displayed using the following, lower-case,
                 names.  Characters greater than 0xff, hexadecimal, are dis-
                 played as hexadecimal strings.

                 000 NUL  001 SOH  002 STX  003 ETX  004 EOT  005 ENQ
                 006 ACK  007 BEL  008 BS   009 HT   00A LF   00B VT
                 00C FF   00D CR   00E SO   00F SI   010 DLE  011 DC1
                 012 DC2  013 DC3  014 DC4  015 NAK  016 SYN  017 ETB
                 018 CAN  019 EM   01A SUB  01B ESC  01C FS   01D GS
                 01E RS   01F US   0FF DEL

     The default and supported byte counts for the conversion characters are
     as follows:

           %_c, %_p, %_u, %c       One byte counts only.

           %d, %i, %o, %u, %X, %x  Four byte default, one, two and four byte
                                   counts supported.

           %E, %e, %f, %G, %g      Eight byte default, four and twelve byte
                                   counts supported.

     The amount of data interpreted by each format string is the sum of the
     data required by each format unit, which is the iteration count times the
     byte count, or the iteration count times the number of bytes required by
     the format if the byte count is not specified.

     The input is manipulated in ``blocks'', where a block is defined as the
     largest amount of data specified by any format string.  Format strings
     interpreting less than an input block's worth of data, whose last format
     unit both interprets some number of bytes and does not have a specified
     iteration count, have the iteration count incremented until the entire
     input block has been processed or there is not enough data remaining in
     the block to satisfy the format string.

     If, either as a result of user specification or hheexxdduummpp modifying the
     iteration count as described above, an iteration count is greater than
     one, no trailing whitespace characters are output during the last itera-
     tion.

     It is an error to specify a byte count as well as multiple conversion
     characters or strings unless all but one of the conversion characters or
     strings is __aa or __AA.

     If, as a result of the specification of the --nn option or end-of-file
     being reached, input data only partially satisfies a format string, the
     input block is zero-padded sufficiently to display all available data
     (i.e., any format units overlapping the end of data will display some
     number of the zero bytes).

     Further output by such format strings is replaced by an equivalent number
     of spaces.  An equivalent number of spaces is defined as the number of
     spaces output by an ss conversion character with the same field width and
     precision as the original conversion character or conversion string but
     with any ``+'', `` '', ``#'' conversion flag characters removed, and ref-
     erencing a NULL string.

     If no format strings are specified, the default display is a one-byte
     hexadecimal display.

     The hheexxdduummpp utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     Note that the following format strings, used with --ee, must be enclosed in
     single quotes.

     Display the input in perusal format:

           ""%06.6_ao ""  12/1 ""%3_u ""
           ""\t\t"" ""%_p ""
           ""\n""

     Implement the -x option:

           ""%07.7_Ax\n""
           ""%07.7_ax  "" 8/2 ""%04x "" ""\n""

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     llllddbb is the command line interface for the LLDB debugger library.  llllddbb
     can debug C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++ and Swift programs.

     The following options are available:

     --hh,, ----hheellpp
             Prints out the usage information for the llllddbb debugger.  The
             ----hheellpp text may be more up-to-date and authoritative than the
             command line options described in this man page.

     --vv,, ----vveerrssiioonn
             Prints out the version number of the llllddbb debugger.

     --aa,, ----aarrcchh _a_r_c_h
             Specifies which architecture llllddbb will use when launching the
             specified program (assuming the provided executable is built for
             multiple architectures.)

     --ff,, ----ffiillee _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
             Specifies the executable file that llllddbb will be launching /
             attaching to.

     --nn,, ----aattttaacchh--nnaammee _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_-_n_a_m_e
             Specifies the name of a currently-running process to attach to.
             (or the name of a process to wait for if --ww is used.)

     --ww,, ----wwaaiitt--ffoorr
             When used in concert with --nn _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_-_n_a_m_e, indicates that llllddbb
             should wait for a new process of that name to be started -- and
             attach to it as early in the process-launch as possible.

     --pp,, ----aattttaacchh--ppiidd _p_i_d
             Specifies a currently running process that llllddbb should attach to.

     --cc,, ----ccoorree _c_o_r_e_-_f_i_l_e
             Specifies the core file to examine.

     --ll,, ----ssccrriipptt--llaanngguuaaggee _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e
             Tells the debugger to use the specified scripting language for
             user-defined scripts, rather than the default.  Valid scripting
             languages that can be specified include Python, Perl, Ruby and
             Tcl.  Currently only the Python extensions have been implemented.

     --dd,, ----ddeebbuugg
             Tells the debugger to print out extra information for debugging
             itself.

     --ss,, ----ssoouurrccee _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
             Tells llllddbb to read in and execute the file ""_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e"", which
             should contain llllddbb commands.

     --ee,, ----eeddiittoorr
             Instructs llllddbb to open source files using the host's ""external
             editor"" mechanism.

     --xx,, ----nnoo--llllddbbiinniitt
             Do not automatically parse any '.lldbinit' files.

             (If you do not provide -f then the first argument will be the
             file to be debugged so 'lldb -- <filename> [<ARG1> [<ARG2>]]'
             also works.  Remember to end the options with ""--"" if any of your
             arguments have a ""-"" in them.)

UUSSIINNGG LLLLDDBB
     In llllddbb there is a hheellpp command which can be used to find descriptions
     and examples of all llllddbb commands.  To get help on ""bbrreeaakkppooiinntt sseett"" you
     would type ""hheellpp bbrreeaakkppooiinntt sseett"".

     There is also an aapprrooppooss command which will search the help text of all
     commands for a given term -- this is useful for locating a command by
     topic.  For instance, ""aapprrooppooss bbrreeaakkppooiinntt"" will list any command that has
     the word ""bbrreeaakkppooiinntt"" in its help text.

FFIILLEESS
     llllddbb will read settings/aliases/commands from three files at startup, if
     they exist.

     First, it will read a _~_/_._l_l_d_b_i_n_i_t_-_d_e_b_u_g_g_e_r command file.  If you are
     using the llllddbb command line interface, this is _~_/_._l_l_d_b_i_n_i_t_-_l_l_d_b.  If you
     are using llllddbb inside a GUI debugger like XXccooddee this will be
     _~_/_._l_l_d_b_i_n_i_t_-_X_c_o_d_e.  This is a useful place to put settings that you want
     to apply only when a given llllddbb command interpreter is used.

     Second, _~_/_._l_l_d_b_i_n_i_t is read.

     Third, an _._l_l_d_b_i_n_i_t file in the current working directory (where llllddbb is
     started) will be read.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     The LLDB project page http://lldb.llvm.org/ has many different resources
     for llllddbb users -- the gdb/lldb command equivalence page
     http://lldb.llvm.org/lldb-gdb.html can be especially helpful for users

     Disk images are data containers that emulate disks.  Like disks, they can
     be partitioned and formatted.  Many common uses of disk images blur the
     distinction between the disk image container and its content, but this
     distinction is critical to understanding how disk images work.  The terms
     ""attach"" and ""detach"" are used to distinguish the way disk images are
     connected to and disconnected from a system.  ""Mount"" and ""unmount"" are
     the parallel filesystems options.

     For example, when you double-click a disk image in the macOS Finder, two
     separate things happen.  First, the image is ""attached"" to the system
     just like an external drive.  Then, the kernel and Disk Arbitration probe
     the new device for recognized file structures.  If any are discovered
     that should be mounted, the associated volumes will mount and appear on
     the desktop.

     When using disk images, always consider whether an operation applies to
     the blocks of the disk image container or to the (often file-oriented)
     content of the image.  For example, hhddiiuuttiill vveerriiffyy verifies that the
     blocks stored in a read-only disk image have not changed since it was
     created.  It does not check whether the filesystem stored within the
     image is self-consistent (as ddiisskkuuttiill vveerriiffyyVVoolluummee would). On the other
     hand, hhddiiuuttiill ccrreeaattee --ssrrccffoollddeerr creates a disk image container, puts a
     filesystem in it, and then copies the specified files to the new filesys-
     tem.

     The following option descriptions apply to all verbs:

     --vveerrbboossee be verbose: produce extra progress output and error diagnostics.
              This option can help the user decipher why a particular opera-
              tion failed.  At a minimum, the probing of any specified images
              will be detailed.

     --qquuiieett   close stdout and stderr, leaving only hhddiiuuttiill's exit status to
              indicate success or failure.  No /dev entries or mount points
              will be printed.  --ddeebbuugg and --vveerrbboossee disable --qquuiieett.

     --ddeebbuugg   be very verbose.  This option is good if a large amount of
              progress information is needed.  As of Mac OS X 10.6, --ddeebbuugg
              enables --vveerrbboossee.

     Many hhddiiuuttiill verbs understand the following options:

     --pplliisstt          provide result output in plist format.  Other programs
                     invoking hhddiiuuttiill are expected to use --pplliisstt rather than
                     try to parse the human-readable output.  The usual output
                     is consistent but generally unstructured.

     --ppuuppppeettssttrriinnggss  provide progress output that is easy for another program
                     to parse.  PERCENTAGE outputs can include the value -1
                     which means hhddiiuuttiill is performing an operation that will
                     take an indeterminate amount of time to complete.  Any
                     program trying to interpret hhddiiuuttiill's progress should use
                     --ppuuppppeettssttrriinnggss.

     --ssrrcciimmaaggeekkeeyy _k_e_y_=_v_a_l_u_e
                     specify a key/value pair for the disk image recognition
                     system.  (--iimmaaggeekkeeyy is normally a synonym)

     --ttggttiimmaaggeekkeeyy _k_e_y_=_v_a_l_u_e
                     specify a key/value pair for any image created.
                     (--iimmaaggeekkeeyy is only a synonym if there is no input image).

     --eennccrryyppttiioonn [_A_E_S_-_1_2_8_|_A_E_S_-_2_5_6]
                     specify a particular type of encryption or, if not speci-
                     fied, the default encryption algorithm.  As of OS X 10.7,
                     the default algorithm is the AES cipher running in CBC
                     mode on 512-byte blocks with a 128-bit key.

     --ssttddiinnppaassss      read a null-terminated passphrase from standard input.
                     If the standard input is a tty, the passphrase will be
                     read with readpassphrase(3).  Otherwise, the password is
                     read from stdin.  --ssttddiinnppaassss replaces --ppaasssspphhrraassee which
                     has been deprecated.  --ppaasssspphhrraassee is insecure because its
                     argument appears in the output of ps(1) where it is visi-
                     ble to other users and processes on the system.  See
                     EXAMPLES.

     --aaggeennttppaassss      force the default behavior of prompting for a passphrase.
                     Useful with --ppuubbkkeeyy to create an image protected by both
                     a passphrase and a public key.

     --rreeccoovveerr _k_e_y_c_h_a_i_n___f_i_l_e
                     specify a keychain containing the secret corresponding to
                     the certificate specified with --cceerrttiiffiiccaattee when the
                     image was created.

     --cceerrttiiffiiccaattee _c_e_r_t___f_i_l_e
                     specify a secondary access certificate for an encrypted
                     image.  _c_e_r_t___f_i_l_e must be DER-encoded certificate data,
                     which can be created by Keychain Access or openssl(1).

     --ppuubbkkeeyy _P_K_1_,_P_K_2_,_._._._,_P_K_n
                     specify a list of public keys, identified by their hexa-
                     decimal hashes, to be used to protect the encrypted image
                     being created.

     --ccaacceerrtt _c_e_r_t    specify a certificate authority certificate.  _c_e_r_t can be
                     either a PEM file or a directory of certificates pro-
                     cessed by c_rehash(1).  See also ----ccaappaatthh and ----ccaacceerrtt in
                     curl(1).

     --iinnsseeccuurreehhttttpp   ignore SSL host validation failures.  Useful for self-
                     signed servers for which the appropriate certificates are
                     unavailable or if access to a server is desired when the
                     server name doesn't match what is in the certificate.

     --sshhaaddooww [_s_h_a_d_o_w_f_i_l_e]
                     Use a shadow file in conjunction with the data in the
                     primary image file.  This option prevents modification of
                     the original image and allows read-only images to be
                     attached read/write.  When blocks are being read from the
                     image, blocks present in the shadow file override blocks
                     in the base image.  All data written to an attached
                     device will be redirected to the shadow file.  If not
                     specified, _s_h_a_d_o_w_f_i_l_e defaults to _i_m_a_g_e.shadow. If the
                     shadow file does not exist, it is created.  hhddiiuuttiill verbs
                     taking images as input accept --sshhaaddooww, --ccaacceerrtt, and
                     --iinnsseeccuurreehhttttpp.

     Verbs that create images automatically append the correct extension to
     any filenames if the extension is not already present.  The creation
     engine also examines the filename extension of the provided filename and
     changes its behavior accordingly.  For example, a sparse bundle image can
     be created without specifying -type SPARSEBUNDLE simply by appending the
     .sparsebundle extension to the provided filename.

VVEERRBBSS
     Each verb is listed with its description and individual arguments.  Argu-
     ments to the verbs can be passed in any order.  A sector is 512 bytes.

     hheellpp       display minimal usage information for each verb.  hhddiiuuttiill _v_e_r_b
                --hheellpp will provide basic usage information for that verb.

     aattttaacchh _i_m_a_g_e [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s]
                attach a disk image as a device.  aattttaacchh will return informa-
                tion about an already-attached image as if it had attached it.
                If any associated volumes are unmounted (and mounting is not
                suppressed), they will be remounted.  mmoouunntt is a poorly-named
                synonym for aattttaacchh.  See BACKGROUND.

                By default, the system applies additional mount options to
                filesystems backed by untrusted devices like disk images:
                options like nosuid and quarantine.  PERMISSIONS VS. OWNERS
                explains the behavior of such filesystems and EXAMPLES shows
                how to override some of the default behavior.

                The output of aattttaacchh has been stable since Mac OS X 10.0
                (though it was called hdid(8) then) and is intended to be pro-
                gram-readable.  It consists of the /dev node, a tab, a content
                hint (if applicable), another tab, and a mount point (if any
                filesystems were mounted).  Because content hints are derived
                from the partition data, GUID Partition Table types may leak
                through.  Common GUIDs such as ""48465300-0000-11AA-
                AA11-0030654"" are mapped to their human-readable counterparts
                (here ""Apple_HFS"").

                Common options: --eennccrryyppttiioonn, --ssttddiinnppaassss, --rreeccoovveerr, --iimmaaggeekkeeyy,
                --sshhaaddooww, --ppuuppppeettssttrriinnggss, and --pplliisstt.

                Options:
                --rreeaaddoonnllyy          force the resulting device to be read-only
                --rreeaaddwwrriittee         attempt to override the DiskImages frame-
                                   work's decision to attach a particular
                                   image read-only.  For example, --rreeaaddwwrriittee
                                   can be used to modify the HFS+ filesystem
                                   on a HFS+/ISO hybrid CD image.
                --nnookkeerrnneell          attach with a helper process.  This is
                                   (again) the default as of Mac OS X 10.5.
                --kkeerrnneell            attempt to attach this image without a
                                   helper process; fail if unsupported.  Only
                                   UDRW, UDRO, UDZO, ULFO, and UDSP images are
                                   supported in-kernel.  Encryption and HTTP
                                   are supported by the kernel driver.
                --nnoottrreemmoovvaabbllee      prevent this image from being detached.
                                   Only root can use this option.  A reboot is
                                   necessary to cleanly detach an image
                                   attached with --nnoottrreemmoovvaabbllee.

                --mmoouunntt _r_e_q_u_i_r_e_d_|_o_p_t_i_o_n_a_l_|_s_u_p_p_r_e_s_s_e_d
                                   indicate whether filesystems in the image
                                   should be mounted or not.  The default is
                                   _r_e_q_u_i_r_e_d (aattttaacchh will fail if no filesys-
                                   tems mount).
                --nnoommoouunntt           identical to --mmoouunntt _s_u_p_p_r_e_s_s_e_d.
                --mmoouunnttrroooott _p_a_t_h    mount volumes on subdirectories of _p_a_t_h
                                   instead of under _/_V_o_l_u_m_e_s.  _p_a_t_h must
                                   exist.  Full mount point paths must be less
                                   than MNAMELEN characters (increased from 90
                                   to 1024 in Mac OS X 10.6).
                --mmoouunnttrraannddoomm _p_a_t_h  like --mmoouunnttrroooott, but mount point directory
                                   names are randomized with mkdtemp(3).
                --mmoouunnttppooiinntt _p_a_t_h   assuming only one volume, mount it at _p_a_t_h

                _d_e_v___n_a_m_e is a partial /dev node path (e.g. ""disk1"").  As of
                Mac OS X 10.4, _d_e_v___n_a_m_e can also be a mountpoint.  If Disk
                Arbitration is running, ddeettaacchh will use it to unmount any
                filesystems and detach the image.  If not, ddeettaacchh will attempt
                to unmount any filesystems and detach the image directly
                (using the `eject' ioctl).  If Disk Arbitration is not run-
                ning, it may be necessary to unmount the filesystems with
                umount(8) before detaching the image.  eejjeecctt is a synonym for
                ddeettaacchh.  In common operation, ddeettaacchh is very similar to
                diskutil(8)'s eejjeecctt.

                and verify it against the value stored in the image.
                Read/write images don't contain checksums and thus can't be
                verified.  vveerriiffyy accepts the common options --eennccrryyppttiioonn,

     ccrreeaattee _s_i_z_e___s_p_e_c _i_m_a_g_e
                create a new image of the given size or from the provided
                data.  If _i_m_a_g_e already exists, --oovv must be specified or
                ccrreeaattee will fail.  To make a cross-platform CD or DVD, use
                mmaakkeehhyybbrriidd instead.  See also EXAMPLES below.

                The size specified is the size of the image to be created.
                Filesystem and partition layout overhead (80 sectors for the
                default GPTSPUD layout on Intel machines) may not be available
                for the filesystem and user data in the image.
                Size specifiers:
                --ssiizzee _?_?_b_|_?_?_k_|_?_?_m_|_?_?_g_|_?_?_t_|_?_?_p_|_?_?_e
                           Specify the size of the image in the style of
                           mkfile(8) with the addition of tera-, peta-, and
                           exa-bytes sizes (note that 'b' specifies a number
                           of sectors, not bytes).  The larger sizes are use-
                           ful for large sparse images.
                --sseeccttoorrss _s_e_c_t_o_r___c_o_u_n_t
                           Specify the size of the image file in 512-byte sec-
                           tors.
                --mmeeggaabbyytteess _s_i_z_e
                           Specify the size of the image file in megabytes
                           (1024*1024 bytes).

                --ssrrccffoollddeerr _s_o_u_r_c_e
                           copies file-by-file the contents of _s_o_u_r_c_e into
                           _i_m_a_g_e, creating a fresh (theoretically defrag-
                           mented) filesystem on the destination.  The result-
                           ing image is thus recommended for use with asr(8)
                           since it will have a minimal amount of unused
                           space.  Its size will be that of the source data
                           plus some padding for filesystem overhead.  The
                           filesystem type of the image volume will match that
                           of the source as closely as possible unless over-
                           ridden with --ffss.  Other size specifiers, such as
                           --ssiizzee, will override the default size calculation
                           based on the source content, allowing for more or
                           less free space in the resulting filesystem.
                           --ssrrccffoollddeerr can be specified more than once, in
                           which case the image volume will be populated at
                           the top level with a copy of each specified
                           filesystem object.  --ssrrccddiirr is a synonym.
                --ssrrccddeevviiccee _d_e_v_i_c_e
                           specifies that the blocks of _d_e_v_i_c_e should be used
                           to create a new image.  The image size will match
                           the size of _d_e_v_i_c_e.  rreessiizzee can be used to adjust
                           the size of resizable filesystems and writable
                           images.  Both --ssrrccddeevviiccee and --ssrrccffoollddeerr can run
                           into errors if there are bad blocks on a disk.  One
                           way around this problem is to write over the files
                           in question in the hopes that the drive will remap
                           the bad blocks.  Data will be lost, but the image
                           creation operation will subsequently succeed.
                           Filesystem options (like --ffss, --vvoollnnaammee, --ssttrreettcchh,
                           or --ssiizzee) are invalid and ignored when using
                           --ssrrccddeevviiccee.

                Common options: --eennccrryyppttiioonn, --ssttddiinnppaassss, --cceerrttiiffiiccaattee,

                sparse and shadow images that can be attached on Mac OS X
                10.1.  --iimmaaggeekkeeyy _e_n_c_r_y_p_t_e_d_-_e_n_c_o_d_i_n_g_-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n can select between
                version 1 and version 2 of the encrypted encoding.  The frame-
                work preferences have a corresponding key to change the
                default for all images.  Version 2 is not compatible with Mac
                OS X 10.2 but is more robust for SPARSE (UDSP) images.  Ver-
                sion 1 is the default for non-sparse images.  As of Mac OS X
                10.4.7, sparse encrypted images always use version 2 and as of
                Mac OS X 10.5, all encrypted images default to version 2.

                General options:
                --aalliiggnn _a_l_i_g_n_m_e_n_t
                          specifies a size to which the final data partition
                          will be aligned.  The default is 4K.

                --ttyyppee _U_D_I_F_|_S_P_A_R_S_E_|_S_P_A_R_S_E_B_U_N_D_L_E
                          --ttyyppee is particular to ccrreeaattee and is used to specify
                          the format of empty read/write images.  It is inde-
                          pendent of --ffoorrmmaatt which is used to specify the
                          final read-only image format when populating an
                          image with pre-existing content.

                          UDIF is the default type.  If specified, a UDRW of
                          the specified size will be created.  SPARSE creates
                          a UDSP: a read/write single-file image which expands
                          as is is filled with data.  SPARSEBUNDLE creates a
                          UDSB: a read/write image backed by a directory bun-
                          dle.

                          By default, UDSP images grow one megabyte at a time.
                          Introduced in 10.5, UDSB images use 8 MB band files
                          which grow as they are written to.  --iimmaaggeekkeeyy
                          _s_p_a_r_s_e_-_b_a_n_d_-_s_i_z_e_=_s_i_z_e can be used to specify the
                          number of 512-byte sectors that will be added each
                          time the image grows.  Valid values for SPARSEBUNDLE
                          range from 2048 to 16777216 sectors (1 MB to 8 GB).

                          The maximum size of a SPARSE image is 128 petabytes;
                          the maximum for SPARSEBUNDLE is just under 8
                          exabytes (2^63 - 512 bytes).  The amount of data
                          that can be stored in either type of sparse image is
                          additionally bounded by the filesystem in the image
                          and by any partition map.  ccoommppaacctt can reclaim
                          unused bands in sparse images backing APFS or HFS+
                          filesystems.  rreessiizzee will only change the virtual

                          can be anything supported by MediaKit.framework.
                          NONE creates an image with no partition map.  When
                          such an image is attached, a single /dev entry will
                          be created (e.g. /dev/disk1).

                          `SPUD' causes a DDM and an Apple Partition Scheme
                          partition map with a single entry to be written.
                          `GPTSPUD' creates a similar image but with a GUID
                          Partition Scheme map instead.  When attached, multi-
                          ple /dev entries will be created, with either slice
                          1 (GPT) or slice 2 (APM) as the data partition.
                          (e.g. /dev/disk1, /dev/disk1s1, /dev/disk1s2).

                          Unless overridden by --ffss, the default layout is
                          `GPTSPUD' (PPC systems used `SPUD' prior to Mac OS X
                          10.6).  Other layouts include `MBRSPUD' and `ISOCD'.

                tication if it detects an unreadable file, a file owned by
                someone other than the user creating the image, or a SGID file

                Other options:
                --ddeevviiccee            specify a device to use for burning.  See
                                   --lliisstt.
                --tteessttbbuurrnn          don't turn on laser (laser defaults to on).
                --aannyyddeevviiccee         explicitly allow burning to devices not

                --[[nnoo]]eejjeecctt         do [not] eject disc after burning. The
                                   default is to eject the disc.
                --[[nnoo]]vveerriiffyybbuurrnn    do [not] verify disc contents after burn.
                                   The default is to verify.

                --[[nnoo]]aaddddppmmaapp       do [not] add partition map if necessary.
                                   Some filesystem types will not be recog-
                                   nized when stored on optical media unless
                                   they are enclosed in a partition map.  This
                                   option will add a partition map to any bare
                                   filesystem which needs a partition map in
                                   order to be recognized when burned to opti-
                                   cal media.  The default is to add the par-
                                   tition map if needed.

                --[[nnoo]]sskkiippffiinnaallffrreeee do [not] skip final free partition.  If
                                   there is a partition map on the image spec-
                                   ifying an Apple_Free partition as the last
                                   partition, that Apple_Free partition will
                                   not be burned.  The burned partition map
                                   will still reference the empty space.  The
                                   default is to skip burning a final free
                                   partition.

                --[[nnoo]]ooppttiimmiizzeeiimmaaggee do [not] optimize filesystem for burning.
                                   Optimization can reduce the size of an HFS+
                                   volume to the size of the data contained on
                                   the volume.  This option will change what
                                   is burned such that the disc will have a
                                   different checksum than the image it came
                                   from.  The default is to burn all blocks of
                                   the disk image (minus any trailing
                                   Apple_Free).

                --[[nnoo]]ffoorrcceecclloossee    do [not] force the disc to be closed after
                                   burning.  Further burns to the disc will be
                                   impossible.  The default is not to close
                                   the disc.

                --nnoouunnddeerrrruunn        Disable the default buffer underrun protec-

                --[[nnoo]]ssyynntthheessiizzee    [Don't] Synthesize a hybrid filesystem for
                                   the disc.  The default is to create a new
                                   (HFS+/ISO) filesystem when burning the
                                   source image's blocks would not result in a
                                   valid disc.

                                   The desired ""x-factor"".  e.g. 8 means the
                                   drive will be instructed burn at ""8x
                                   speed"".  `max' will cause the burn to pro-
                                   ceed at the maximum speed of the drive.
                                   `max' is the default speed.  Slower speeds
                                   can produce more reliable burns.  The speed
                                   factor is relative to the media being
                                   burned (e.g.  --ssppeeeedd _2 has a different data
                                   rate when used for a DVD burn vs. a CD
                                   burn).  Note that some drives have a mini-
                                   mum burn speed in which case any slower
                                   speed specified will result in a burn at
                                   the drive's minimum speed.

                --ssiizzeeqquueerryy         calculate the size of disc required without
                                   burning anything.  The size is returned in
                                   sectors.

                --eerraassee             prompt for optical media (DVD-RW/CD-RW) and

                                   erase the media.  If an image is specified,
                                   it will be burned to the media after the
                                   media has been erased.
                --ffuulllleerraassee         erase all sectors of the disc.  This usu-

                Generate a potentially-hybrid filesystem in a read-only disk
                image using the DiscRecording framework's content creation
                system.  This disk image will represent a data disc.
                drutil(1) can be used to make audio discs.

                _s_o_u_r_c_e can either be a directory or a disk image.  The gener-
                ated image can later be burned using bbuurrnn, or converted to
                another read-only format with ccoonnvveerrtt.  By default, the
                filesystem will be readable on most modern computing plat-
                forms.  The generated filesystem is not intended for conver-
                sion to read/write, but can safely have its files copied to a
                read/write filesystem using ditto(8).

                hhddiiuuttiill supports generating El Torito-style bootable ISO9660
                filesystems, which are commonly used for booting x86-based
                hardware. The specification includes several emulation modes.
                By default, an El Torito boot image emulates either a 1.2MB,
                1.44MB, or 2.88MB floppy drive, depending on the size of the
                image.  Also available are ""No Emulation"" and ""Hard Disk
                Emulation"" modes, which allow the boot image to either be
                loaded directly into memory, or be virtualized as a parti-
                tioned hard disk, respectively. The El Torito options should
                not be used for data CDs.

                Filesystem options:
                --hhffss    Generate an HFS+ filesystem.  This filesystem can be
                        present on an image simultaneously with an ISO9660 or
                        Joliet or UDF filesystem.  On operating systems that
                        understand HFS+ as well as ISO9660 and UDF, like Mac
                        OS 9 or OS X, HFS+ is usually the preferred filesystem
                        for hybrid images.
                --iissoo    Generate an ISO9660 Level 2 filesystem with Rock Ridge
                        extensions.  This filesystem can be present on an
                        image simultaneously with an HFS+ or Joliet or UDF
                        filesystem.  ISO9660 is the standard cross-platform
                        interchange format for CDs and some DVDs, and is
                        understood by virtually all operating systems.  If an
                        ISO9660 or Joliet filesystem is present on a disk
                        image or CD, but not HFS+, OS X will use the ISO9660
                        (or Joliet) filesystem.
                --jjoolliieett Generate Joliet extensions to ISO9660.  This view of
                        the filesystem can be present on an image simultane-
                        ously with HFS+, and requires the presence of an
                        ISO9660 filesystem.  Joliet supports Unicode file-
                        names, but is only supported on some operating sys-
                        tems.  If both an ISO9660 and Joliet filesystem are
                        present on a disk image or CD, but not HFS+, OS X will
                        prefer the Joliet filesystem.
                --uuddff    Generate a UDF filesystem. This filesystem can be
                        present on an image simultaneously with HFS+, ISO9660,
                        and Joliet. UDF is the standard interchange format for
                        DVDs, although operating system support varies based
                        on OS version and UDF version.

                By default, if no filesystem is specified, the image will be
                created with all four filesystems as a hybrid image.  When
                multiple filesystems are selected, the data area of the image
                is shared between all filesystems, and only directory informa-
                tion and volume meta-data are unique to each filesystem.  This
                means that creating a cross-platform ISO9660/HFS+ hybrid has a
                minimal overhead when compared to a single filesystem image.

                Other options (most take a single argument):
                --hhffss--bblleesssseedd--ddiirreeccttoorryy Path to directory which should be

                Common options: --rreeccoovveerr and --ssrrcciimmaaggeekkeeyy.  The options

     eerraasseekkeeyyss _i_m_a_g_e
                delete keys used to access an encrypted image, quickly render-
                ing the image inaccessible.  This does not prevent other
                copies of the keys from later being broken and used to decrypt
                the data, such as from a copy or backup of the image.  In
                addition, modern storage systems such as solid state disks do
                not securely overwrite data.  As a result, eerraasseekkeeyyss cannot
                protect against all attacks, but it may prevent trivial
                access.

                Common options: --pplliisstt and --qquuiieett.

     uunnffllaatttteenn _i_m_a_g_e
                unflatten a UDIF disk image, creating an OS 9-style dual-fork
                image file (no XML metadata).  If the resource fork represen-
                tation of the metadata becomes greater than 16 MB, the opera-

     ffllaatttteenn _i_m_a_g_e
                Flatten a read-only (or compressed) UDIF disk image into a
                single-fork file.  By default, metadata will be stored both as
                XML (for the kernel's use) and in an embedded resource fork
                (for Mac OS X 10.1 and earlier).

                Common options: --ssrrcciimmaaggeekkeeyy, --eennccrryyppttiioonn, and --ssttddiinnppaassss.
                Since images are created ""flat"" by default, ffllaatttteenn is only
                required if the UDIF has previously been uunnffllaatttteenned.

                Other options:
                --nnooxxmmll      don't embed XML data for in-kernel attachment.
                            The image will never attach in-kernel.
                --nnoorrssrrccffoorrkk don't embed resource fork data.  The image will
                            not attach on OS X versions prior to Mac OS X
                            10.2.

     ffssiidd _i_m_a_g_e
                Print information about filesystems on a given disk image.
                Per DEVICE SPECIAL FILES, _i_m_a_g_e can be a _/_d_e_v entry corre-
                sponding to a disk.  More detailed information is presented
                for HFS+ filesystems.

     mmoouunnttvvooll _d_e_v___n_a_m_e
                mount the filesystem in _d_e_v___n_a_m_e using Disk Arbitration (simi-
                lar to diskutil(8)'s mmoouunntt). XML output is available from
                --pplliisstt.  Note that mmoouunnttvvooll (rather than mmoouunntt, though it
                often works in Mac OS X 10.5 and later) is the correct way to
                remount a volume after it has been unmounted by uunnmmoouunntt.

                Prior to Mac OS X 10.5, mmoouunntt/aattttaacchh would treat a /dev entry
                as a disk image to be attached (creating another /dev entry).
                That behavior was undesirable.

     uunnmmoouunntt _v_o_l_u_m_e [--ffoorrccee]
                unmount a mounted volume without detaching any associated
                image.  _V_o_l_u_m_e is a /dev entry or mountpoint.  NOTE: uunnmmoouunntt
                does NOT detach any disk image associated with the volume.
                Images are attached and detached; volumes are mounted and
                unmounted.  hhddiiuuttiill mmoouunnttvvooll (or ddiisskkuuttiill mmoouunntt) will remount
                a volume that has been unmounted by hhddiiuuttiill uunnmmoouunntt.

                Options:
                --ffoorrccee   unmount filesystem regardless of open files on that
                         filesystem.  Similar to umount -f.

     rreessiizzee _s_i_z_e___s_p_e_c _i_m_a_g_e
                Resize a disk image or the containers within it.  For an image
                containing a trailing Apple_HFS partition, the default is to
                resize the image container, the partition, and the filesystem
                within it by aligning the end of the hosted structures with
                the end of the image.  hhddiiuuttiill rreessiizzee cannot resize filesys-
                tems other than HFS+ and its variants.

                rreessiizzee can shrink an image so that its HFS+ partition can be
                converted to CD-R/DVD-R format and still be burned.  hhddiiuuttiill
                rreessiizzee will not reclaim gaps because it does not move data.
                diskutil(8)'s rreessiizzee can move filesystem data which can help
                hhddiiuuttiill rreessiizzee create a minimally-sized image.  --ffssaarrggss can
                also be used to minimize filesystem gaps inside an image.

                rreessiizzee is limited by the disk image container format (e.g.
                UDSP vs. UDSB), any partition scheme, the hosted filesystem,
                and the filesystem hosting the image.  In the case of HFS+
                inside of GPT inside of a UDRW on HFS+ with adequate free
                space, the limit is approximately 2^63 bytes.  Older images
                created with an APM partition scheme are limited by it to 2TB.
                Before Mac OS X 10.4, rreessiizzee was limited by how the filesystem
                was created (see hhddiiuuttiill ccrreeaattee --ssttrreettcchh).

                hhddiiuuttiill bbuurrnn does not burn Apple_Free partitions at the end of
                the devices, so an image with a resized filesystem can be
                burned to create a CD-R/DVD-R master that contains only the
                actual data in the hosted filesystem (assuming minimal data
                fragmentation).

                                 image.  On APM, shrinking a partition results
                                 in an explicit Apple_Free entry taking up the
                                 remaining space in the image.

                segment an NDIF or UDIF disk image.  Segmented images work
                around limitations in file size which are sometimes imposed by
                filesystems, network protocols, or media.  Note: whether or
                not the segments are encrypted is determined by the options
                passed to sseeggmmeenntt and not by the state of the source image.

                this report includes starting offsets and significant amounts
                of free space.  _i_m_a_g_e is either a disk image or /dev/disk

     Verifying:
           hdiutil verify myimage.img
                 verifies an image against its internal checksum.

     Segmenting:
           hdiutil segment -segmentSize 10m -o /tmp/aseg 30m.dmg
                 creates aseg.dmg, aseg.002.dmgpart, and aseg.003.dmgpart

     Converting:
           hdiutil convert master.dmg -format UDTO -o master
                 converts master.dmg to a CD-R export image named master.cdr
           hdiutil convert /dev/disk1 -format UDRW -o devimage
                 converts the disk /dev/disk1 to a read/write device image
                 file.  authopen(1) will be used if read access to /dev/rdisk1
                 is not available.  Note use of the block-special device.
           hdiutil convert image.dmg -o image.sparsebundle
                 converts image.dmg to format UDSB by automatically detecting
                 the file extension .sparsebundle.
           hdiutil convert files.sparsebundle -format UDZO \
               -imagekey zlib-level=5 -o files
                 converts files.sparsebundle to files.dmg: a read-only, com-
                 pressed disk image using zlib level 5 instead of the default.
           hdiutil convert stuff.dmg -format UDZO -encryption -o stuff-enc
                 create a copy of stuff.dmg named stuff-enc.dmg which is
                 encrypted with AES-128.

     Burning:
           hdiutil burn myImage.dmg
                 burns the image to optical media and verifies the burn.
           hdiutil burn myRawImage.cdr -noverifyburn -noeject
                 burns the image without verifying the burn or ejecting the
                 disc.  Volumes will be mounted after burning.

     Creating a 50 MB read/write encrypted image:
           hdiutil create -encryption -size 50m e.dmg -fs HFS+J

     Creating a 50 MB read/write encrypted image protected with public key
     only:
           hdiutil create -encryption -size 50m e.dmg -fs HFS+J \
               -pubkey F534A3B0C2AEE3B988308CC89AA04ABE7FDB5F30

     Creating a 50 MB read/write encrypted image protected with public key and
     password:
           hdiutil create -encryption -size 50m e.dmg -fs HFS+J -agentpass \
               -pubkey F534A3B0C2AEE3B988308CC89AA04ABE7FDB5F30

     Note that these two -pubkey usage examples assume a certificate corre-
     sponding to this public key is currently in the user's keychain or smart
     card.  For additional information on smart card authorization setup see
     sc_auth(8).

     Creating an encrypted single-partition image without user interaction:
           printf pp|hdiutil create -encryption -stdinpass -size 9m sp.dmg

     Creating a ""1 GB"" SPARSE image (a 1 GB filesystem in a growable file):
           hdiutil create -type SPARSE -size 1g -fs HFS+J growableTo1g

     Creating a ""1 GB"" SPARSEBUNDLE (a 1 GB filesystem in a growable bundle):
           hdiutil create -type SPARSEBUNDLE -size 1g -fs HFS+J growableTo1g

     Creating a new mounted volume backed by an image:
           hdiutil create -volname Dick -size 1.3m -fs HFS+ -attach Moby.dmg

     Attaching an image on a web server to the system, with any writes going
     to a local file:
           hdiutil attach https://my.webserver.com/master.dmg \
               -shadow /tmp/mastershadowfile

     Using a shadow file to attach a read-only image read/write to modify it,
     then convert it back to a read-only image. This method eliminates the
     time/space required to convert a image to read/write before modifying it.

           hdiutil attach -owners on Moby.dmg -shadow
           /dev/disk2   Apple_partition_scheme
           /dev/disk2s1 Apple_partition_map
           /dev/disk2s2 Apple_HFS               /Volumes/Dick

           ditto /Applications/Preview.app /Volumes/Dick
           hdiutil detach /dev/disk2
           hdiutil convert -format UDZO Moby.dmg -shadow

     Creating a RAM-backed device and filesystem:

           NUMSECTORS=128000       # a sector is 512 bytes
           mydev=`hdiutil attach -nomount ram://$NUMSECTORS`
           newfs_hfs $mydev
           mkdir /tmp/mymount
           mount -t hfs $mydev /tmp/mymount

     Using makehybrid to create cross-platform data with files overlapping
     between filesystem views, containing these files:
           albumlist.txt song2.wma     song4.m4a     song6.mp3     song8.mp3
           song1.wma     song3.m4a     song5.mp3     song7.mp3

           hdiutil makehybrid -o MusicBackup.iso Music -hfs -iso -joliet \
               -hide-hfs 'Music/*.wma' -hide-joliet 'Music/{*.m4a,*.mp3}' \
               -hide-iso 'Music/*.{wma,m4a}'

     will create an image with three filesystems pointing to the same blocks.
     The HFS+ filesystem, typically only visible on Macintosh systems, will
     not include the .wma files, but will show the .m4a and .mp3 files. The
     Joliet filesystem will not show the .m4a and .mp3 files, but will show
     the .wma files. The ISO9660 filesystem, typically the default filesystem
     for optical media on many platforms, will only show the .mp3 files. All
     three filesystems will include the ""albumlist.txt"" files.

     Image from directory:
           hdiutil create -srcfolder mydir mydir.dmg
                 This method uses the least disk space during image creation,
                 but the resulting image may be slightly less space efficient.

     Image from directory using an intermediate sparse bundle:
           hdiutil create -srcfolder mydir -format UDSB mydir.sparsebundle
           hdiutil convert mydir.sparsebundle -format UDZO -o mydir.dmg
                 This method produces space-optimal images, but requires much
                 more disk space during image creation. The intermediate
                 sparse bundle image can be removed after the process is com-
                 plete.

     Manually changing ownership settings of a read-only disk image:
           hdiutil attach myimage.dmg
           ...
           /dev/disk1s2            Apple_HFS         /Volumes/myVolume
           diskutil unmount disk1s2
           mkdir /Volumes/myVolume
           sudo mount -r -t hfs -o owners /dev/disk1s2 /Volumes/myVolume
           # -o owners is the default for manual mounts

     Forcing a known image to attach:
           hdiutil attach -imagekey diskimage-class=CRawDiskImage myBlob.bar

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     The following environment variables affect hhddiiuuttiill and DiskImages:

                Make aattttaacchh behave as if --kkeerrnneell was passed.  In Mac OS X
                10.4.x, in-kernel was the default behavior for UDRW and SPARSE
                images.  In Mac OS X 10.5 and later, these and other kernel-
                compatible images again default to attaching with a user
                process.  If an image is not ""kernel-compatible"" and in-kernel
                mounting is specified, the attach will fail.  WARNING: ram://

EERRRROORRSS
     DiskImages uses many frameworks and can encounter many error codes.  In
     general, it tries to turn these error numbers into localized strings for
     the user.  For background, intro(2) is a good explanation of our primary
     error domain: the BSD errno values.  For debugging, --vveerrbboossee should gen-
     erally provide enough information to figure out what has gone wrong.  The
     following is a list of interesting errors that hdiutil may encounter:

     No mountable filesystems
                        The ""No mountable filesystems"" error from hhddiiuuttiill
                        aattttaacchh means that no filesystems could be recognized
                        or mounted after the disk image was attached.  The
                        default behavior in this case is to detach the disk
                        image.  See aattttaacchh for options modifying this behav-
                        ior.  This error can occur if the disk image or con-
                        tained filesystem is corrupt.  It can also occur if an
                        image was created from a block device containing a
                        mounted, journaled filesystem (in which case the image
                        contains a dirty journal that can't be replayed with-
                        out making the image read/write, such as with aattttaacchh
                        --sshhaaddooww).

     [ENXIO]            Device not configured.  This error is returned explic-
                        itly by DiskImages when its kernel driver or framework
                        helper cannot be contacted.  It also often shows up
                        when a device has been removed while I/O is still
                        active.  One common case of the helper not being found
                        is when Foundation's Distributed Objects RPC mechanism
                        cannot be configured.  D.O. doesn't work under dead
                        Mach bootstrap contexts such as can exist in a reat-
                        tached screen(1) session.  Root users can take advan-

                        too large for the server to support access via Range
                        requests.  Segmented images can sometimes be used to
                        work around this limitation of older HTTP servers.
                        This error can also occur if an overflow occurs with

     [EAGAIN]           Resource temporarily unavailable.  As of Mac OS X
                        10.5, DiskImages uses read/write locks on its image
                        files to prevent images from being attached on more
                        than one machine at a time (e.g. over the network).
                        EAGAIN is returned if the appropriate read or write
                        lock can't be obtained.

     EACCES vs. EPERM   EACCES and EPERM are subtly different.  The latter
                        ""operation not permitted"" tends to refer to an opera-
                        tion that cannot be performed, often due to an incor-
                        rect effective user ID.  On the other hand, ""permis-
                        sion denied"" tends to mean that a particular file
                        access mode prevented the operation.

     As of Mac OS X 10.5, a more reliable, efficient, and scalable sparse for-
     mat, UDSB (SPARSEBUNDLE), is recommended for persistent sparse images as
     long as a backing bundle (directory) is acceptable.  Mac OS X 10.5 also
     introduced F_FULLFSYNC over AFP (on client and server), allowing proper
     journal flushes for HFS+J-bearing images.  Critical data should never be
     stored in sparse disk images on file servers that don't support F_FULLF-
     SYNC.

     SPARSE (UDSP) images and shadow files were designed for intermediate use
     when creating other images (e.g. UDZO) when final image sizes are
     unknown.  Generally speaking, SPARSE images are not recommended for per-
     sistent storage, though they are relatively safe on Mac OS X 10.3.2 and
     later. On versions earlier than 10.3.2, SPARSE should be avoided in favor
     of UDRW images and rreessiizzee.  On Mac OS X 10.5 and later, the more robust
     and faster SPARSEBUNDLE type is preferred.

     Note that both sparse formats, UDSP and UDSB, are growable only up to a
     limit: the size parameter specified when they were created. They will
     take up less space on the hosting filesystem if they contain less data
     than their created size, and grow up to that size as data is added.

     If more space is needed than is referenced by the hosted filesystem,
     hhddiiuuttiill rreessiizzee or diskutil(8) rreessiizzee can help to grow or shrink the
     filesystem in an image.  ccoommppaacctt reclaims unused space in sparse images.
     Though they request that hosted HFS+ filesystems use a special ""front
     first"" allocation policy, beware that sparse images can enhance the
     effects of any fragmentation in the hosted filesystem.

     To prevent errors when a filesystem inside of a sparse image has more
     free space than the volume holding the sparse image, HFS+ volumes inside
     sparse images will report an amount of free space slightly less than the
     amount of free space on the volume on which image resides.  The image
     filesystem currently only behaves this way as a result of a direct aattttaacchh
     action and will not behave this way if, for example, the filesystem is
     unmounted and remounted.  Moving the image file to a different volume
     with sufficient free space will allow the image's filesystem to grow to
     its full size.

     Since any _/_d_e_v entry can be treated as a raw disk image, it is worth not-
     ing which devices can be accessed when and how.  _/_d_e_v_/_r_d_i_s_k nodes are
     character-special devices, but are ""raw"" in the BSD sense and force
     block-aligned I/O.  They are closer to the physical disk than the buffer
     cache.  _/_d_e_v_/_d_i_s_k nodes, on the other hand, are buffered block-special
     devices and are used primarily by the kernel's filesystem code.

     It is not possible to read from a _/_d_e_v_/_d_i_s_k node while a filesystem is
     mounted from it, but anyone with read access to the appropriate
     _/_d_e_v_/_r_d_i_s_k node can use hhddiiuuttiill verbs such as ffssiidd or ppmmaapp with it.
     Beware that information read from a raw device while a filesystem is
     mounted may not be consistent because the consistent data is stored in
     memory or in the filesystem's journal.

     The DiskImages framework will attempt to use authopen(1) to open any
     device which it can't open (due to EACCES) for reading with open(2).
     Depending on session characteristics, this behavior can cause apparent
     hangs while trying to access _/_d_e_v entries while logged in remotely (an
     authorization panel is waiting on console).

     Generally, the _/_d_e_v_/_d_i_s_k node is preferred for imaging devices (e.g.
     ccoonnvveerrtt or ccrreeaattee --ssrrccddeevviiccee operations), while _/_d_e_v_/_r_d_i_s_k is usable for
     the quick ppmmaapp or ffssiidd.  In particular, converting the blocks of a
     mounted journaled filesystem to a read-only image will prevent the volume
     in the image from mounting (the journal will be permanently dirty).

     Some filesystems support permissions including users and groups.  While
     important for security on a managed filesystem, users and groups (""own-
     ers"") pose challenges for unmanaged, shared filesystems such as those
     typically present in disk images.  macOS's solution to this problem is to
     make owners optional, both while creating files and enforcing permis-
     sions.

     By default, unknown HFS+ filesystems on ""external"" devices (including
     disk images) mount with their owners ignored (mount -o noowners).  Nor-
     mally when owners are ignored, the system uses a special _unknown user
     and group to dynamically substitute the current user's identity for any
     owners recorded in the filesystem.  These _unknown owners are even writ-
     ten to the volume when creating new files.  The new files will continue
     to have ""floating"" ownership when mounted with owners honored.  The net
     result is that shared volumes behave as expected regardless of how they
     are accessed.

     The behavior is different when disk images are attached.  With disk
     images, the owner of all files in a filesystem mount for which owners are
     ignored is the user attaching the disk image.  The attaching owner is
     also used when creating new files.

     On modern macOS systems, root (UID 0) can ""see through"" the ""owners
     ignored"" user mappings.  Thus
           sudo ls -l /Volumes/imageVol
     will show whatever is really stored in the filesystem (possibly _unknown)
     regardless of whether owners are currently being honored on that volume.
     In contrast, non-root users will see themselves any time _unknown is in
     effect, whether the default for the mount when owners are ignored or
     because _unknown is stored on disk.  For disk images, non-root users will
     see owners matching the user that attached the disk image.

     Unlike owners, permissions are never optional.  A non-writable file will
     not be writable just because owners are ignored.  However, a file that is
     writable by its owner will be writable by everyone if _unknown is the
     effective owner of the file for that file.  Because anyone accessing an
     owners-ignored file is treated as the owner, everyone is effectively the
     owner.  Because the default behavior for disk image filesystems is for
     all files to be owned by the user attaching the disk image, other users
     will be treated per the 'group' (if applicable) and 'other' permission
     modes.

     diskutil(8)'s eennaabblleeOOwwnneerrsshhiipp or the Finder's Get Info window can be used
     to configure a system to respect the on-disk owners for a filesystem in
     the future.

     The DiskImages framework supports a variety of flat-file and dual-fork
     image formats, including read/write, read-only, and read-only compressed
     (which are decompressed in small chunks as I/O requests are made).  It
     automatically decodes AppleSingle and MacBinary file formats and is capa-
     ble of mounting most images directly from http:// URLs.  Because DiskIm-
     ages can make many requests over a single connection, responsiveness can
     be improved by modifying HTTP server settings such as apache's Max-
     KeepAliveRequests and KeepAliveTimeout.

     Mac OS X 10.0 supported the disk images of Disk Copy 6 on Mac OS 9.  OS X
     10.1 added sparse, encrypted, and zlib-compressed images.  These images
     will not be recognized on Mac OS X 10.0 (or will attach read/write, pos-
     sibly allowing for their destruction).  As the sparse, shadow, and
     encrypted formats have evolved, switches have been added to facilitate
     the creation of images that are compatible with older OS versions (at the
     expense of the performance and reliability improvements offered by the
     format enhancements).  In particular, sparse images should not be
     expected to attach on versions of OS X older than that which created
     them.

     With Mac OS X 10.2, the most common image formats went ""in-kernel"" (i.e.
     the DiskImages kernel extension served them without a helper process),
     image meta-data began being stored both as XML and in the embedded
     resource fork, and the default Disk Copy.app ""compressed"" format became
     UDZO (breaking compatibility with 10.0).  Mac OS X 10.4 introduced bzip2
     compression in the UDBZ format which provides smaller images (especially
     when combined with mmaakkeehhyybbrriidd) at the expense of backwards compatibility,
     some performance, and kernel compatibility.

     In Mac OS X 10.4.7, the resource forks previously embedded in UDIF images
     were abandoned entirely to avoid metadata length limitations imposed by
     resource fork structures.  As a result, UDIF images created on 10.4.7 and
     later will not, by default, be recognized by either Mac OS X 10.1 or Mac
     OS X 10.0.  ffllaatttteenn can be used to customize the type of metadata stored
     in the image.

     Mac OS X 10.5 introduced sparse bundle images which ccoommppaacctt quickly but
     are not recognized by previous OS versions.  Mac OS X 10.6 removed sup-
     port for attaching SPARSEBUNDLE images from network file servers that
     don't support F_FULLFSYNC, although this requirement was relaxed in macOS
     10.12.  OS X 10.7 removed double-click support for images using legacy
     metadata; these can be rehabilitated using ffllaatttteenn and uunnffllaatttteenn, or sim-
     ply ccoonnvveerrtt.

     OS X 10.11 introduced lzfse compression in the ULFO format, providing
     faster, more efficient compression and smaller images compared to UDZO.
     These images are also supported in-kernel, but will not work on any ear-
     lier versions of the OS.

     macOS 10.12 included a pre-release version of the Apple File System
     called APFS which was meant for evaluation and development purposes only.
     Files stored in APFS-based images may not be accessible in future
     releases of macOS, and won't work in past ones.  All data to be stored in
     APFS volumes should be backed up prior to using APFS and regularly backed
     up while using APFS.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     Disk images were first invented to electronically store and transmit rep-
     resentations of floppy disks for manufacturing replication.  These images
     of floppies are typically referred to as 'Disk Copy 4.2' images, in ref-
     erence to the application that created and restored them to floppy disks.
     Disk Copy 4.2 images were block-for-block representations of a floppy
     disk, with no notion of compression.  DART is a variant of the Disk Copy
     4.2 format that supported compression.

     NDIF (New Disk Image Format) images were developed to replace the Disk
     Copy 4.2 and DART image formats and to support images larger than a
     floppy disk.  With NDIF and Disk Copy version 6, images could be
     ""attached"" as mass storage devices under Mac OS 9.  Apple Data Compres-
     sion (ADC) -- which carefully optimizes for fast decompression -- was
     used to compress images that were typically created once and restored
     many times during manufacturing.

     UDIF (Universal Disk Image Format) device images picked up where NDIF
     left off, allowing images to represent entire block devices and all the
     data therein: DDM, partition map, disk-based drivers, etc.  For example,
     it can represent bootable CDs which can then be replicated from an image.
     To ensure single-fork files (NDIF was dual-fork), it began embedding its
     resource fork in the data fork.  UDIF is the native image format for OS
     X.

     Raw disk images from other operating systems (e.g. .iso files) will be
     recognized as disk images and can be attached and mounted if macOS recog-
     nizes the filesystems.  They can also be burned with hhddiiuuttiill bbuurrnn.

WWHHAATT''SS NNEEWW
     macOS 10.12 introduced the pre-release APFS for evaluation (see COMPATI-
     BILITY above).  10.12 also added an option to disable atomic copying dur-
     ing image from folder operations, --nnooaattoommiicc, which may result in slightly
     faster image creation.  ppmmaapp added a new switch, --ddiiaaggnnoossttiicc, which cap-
     tures troubleshooting information for Boot Camp configurations.

     OS X 10.11 added ULFO format images compressed with lzfse.  These images
     are more efficient and smaller than comparable UDZO images compressed
     with zlib, and retain kernel compatibility, but are not usable on earlier
     OSes.

     OS X 10.10 quadrupled the default UDIF chunk size without affecting back-
     ward compatibility.  UDIF images created or converted on 10.10 will bene-
     fit from smaller metadata and more efficient compression for UDZO and
     especially UDBZ formats.

     OS X 10.7 added the ability to quickly render encrypted images inaccessi-
     ble using the new eerraasseekkeeyyss verb, which saves time versus securely over-
     writing the entire image.

     In Mac OS X 10.6, ppmmaapp was rewritten to use MediaKit's latest reporting
     routines so that it can properly support GPT partition maps.  Also --ddeebbuugg
     now implies --vveerrbboossee for all verbs.

     Mac OS X 10.5 changed the behavior of aattttaacchh when run on an existing
     image or /dev node: if the image was attached but no volume was mounted,
     the volume would be mounted.  Prior systems would return the /dev without
     mounting the volume.  This change effectively removes the ability to cre-
     ate a second /dev node from an existing one.

     sssshh--aadddd adds private key identities to the authentication agent,
     ssh-agent(1).  When run without arguments, it adds the files
     _~_/_._s_s_h_/_i_d___r_s_a, _~_/_._s_s_h_/_i_d___d_s_a, _~_/_._s_s_h_/_i_d___e_c_d_s_a, and _~_/_._s_s_h_/_i_d___e_d_2_5_5_1_9.
     After loading a private key, sssshh--aadddd will try to load corresponding cer-
     tificate information from the filename obtained by appending _-_c_e_r_t_._p_u_b to
     the name of the private key file.  Alternative file names can be given on
     the command line.

     If any file requires a passphrase, sssshh--aadddd asks for the passphrase from
     the user.  The passphrase is read from the user's tty.  sssshh--aadddd retries
     the last passphrase if multiple identity files are given.

     The authentication agent must be running and the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environ-
     ment variable must contain the name of its socket for sssshh--aadddd to work.

     The options are as follows:

     --cc      Indicates that added identities should be subject to confirmation
             before being used for authentication.  Confirmation is performed
             by ssh-askpass(1).  Successful confirmation is signaled by a zero
             exit status from ssh-askpass(1), rather than text entered into
             the requester.

     --DD      Deletes all identities from the agent.

     --dd      Instead of adding identities, removes identities from the agent.
             If sssshh--aadddd has been run without arguments, the keys for the
             default identities and their corresponding certificates will be
             removed.  Otherwise, the argument list will be interpreted as a
             list of paths to public key files to specify keys and certifi-
             cates to be removed from the agent.  If no public key is found at
             a given path, sssshh--aadddd will append _._p_u_b and retry.

     DISPLAY and SSH_ASKPASS
             If sssshh--aadddd needs a passphrase, it will read the passphrase from
             the current terminal if it was run from a terminal.  If sssshh--aadddd
             does not have a terminal associated with it but DISPLAY and
             SSH_ASKPASS are set, it will execute the program specified by
             SSH_ASKPASS (by default ``ssh-askpass'') and open an X11 window
             to read the passphrase.  This is particularly useful when calling
             sssshh--aadddd from a _._x_s_e_s_s_i_o_n or related script.  (Note that on some
             machines it may be necessary to redirect the input from _/_d_e_v_/_n_u_l_l
             to make this work.)

       apachectl - Apache HTTP Server Control Interface


SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       When  acting in pass-through mode, aappaacchheeccttll can take all the arguments
       available for the httpd binary.


       aappaacchheeccttll [ _h_t_t_p_d_-_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t ]


       When acting in SysV init mode, aappaacchheeccttll takes  simple,  one-word  com-
       mands, defined below.


       aappaacchheeccttll _c_o_m_m_a_n_d



SSUUMMMMAARRYY
       aappaacchheeccttll  is  a  front  end  to the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol
       (HTTP) server. It is designed to help  the  administrator  control  the
       functioning of the Apache httpd daemon.


       The  aappaacchheeccttll  script can operate in two modes. First, it can act as a
       simple front-end to the httpd command that simply  sets  any  necessary
       environment  variables and then invokes httpd, passing through any com-
       mand line arguments. Second, aappaacchheeccttll can act as a SysV  init  script,
       taking  simple  one-word  arguments  like ssttaarrtt, rreessttaarrtt, and ssttoopp, and
       translating them into appropriate signals to httpd.


       If your Apache installation uses non-standard paths, you will  need  to
       edit  the  aappaacchheeccttll  script  to set the appropriate paths to the httpd
       binary. You can also specify any necessary  httpd  command  line  argu-
       ments. See the comments in the script for details.


       The  aappaacchheeccttll  script  returns a 0 exit value on success, and >0 if an
       error occurs. For more details, view the comments in the script.



OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Only the SysV init-style options are defined here. Other arguments  are
       defined on the httpd manual page.



       ssttaarrtt  Loads the org.apache.httpd launchd job.

       restart, graceful
              Unloads, then loads the org.apache.httpd launchd job.

       ffuullllssttaattuuss
              Displays a full status report from mod_status. For this to work,
              you need to have mod_status enabled on your server and  a  text-
              based  browser  such  as  llyynnxx available on your system. The URL
              used to access the status report can be set by editing the  SSTTAA--
              TTUUSSUURRLL variable in the script.

       ssttaattuuss Displays  a  brief  status  report.  Similar  to  the ffuullllssttaattuuss
              option, except that the list of requests currently being  served
              is omitted.

              Run  a  configuration file syntax test. It parses the configura-
              tion files and either reports SSyynnttaaxx OOkk or detailed  information
              about  the  particular  syntax  error.  This  is  equivalent  to
              aappaacchheeccttll --tt.


       The following option was available in earlier  versions  but  has  been
       removed.

              To start httpd with SSL support, you should edit your configura-
              tion file to include the relevant directives and  then  use  the
              normal aappaacchheeccttll ssttaarrtt.

     dddd -- convert and copy a file

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
     dddd [_o_p_e_r_a_n_d_s _._._.]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The dddd utility copies the standard input to the standard output.  Input
     data is read and written in 512-byte blocks.  If input reads are short,
     input from multiple reads are aggregated to form the output block.  When
     finished, dddd displays the number of complete and partial input and output
     blocks and truncated input records to the standard error output.

     The following operands are available:

     bbss=_n     Set both input and output block size to _n bytes, superseding the
              iibbss and oobbss operands.  If no conversion values other than
              nnooeerrrroorr, nnoottrruunncc or ssyynncc are specified, then each input block is
              copied to the output as a single block without any aggregation
              of short blocks.

     ccbbss=_n    Set the conversion record size to _n bytes.  The conversion
              record size is required by the record oriented conversion val-
              ues.

     ccoouunntt=_n  Copy only _n input blocks.

     ffiilleess=_n  Copy _n input files before terminating.  This operand is only
              applicable when the input device is a tape.

     iibbss=_n    Set the input block size to _n bytes instead of the default 512.

     iiff=_f_i_l_e  Read input from _f_i_l_e instead of the standard input.

     iisseeeekk=_n  Seek on the input file _n blocks.  This is synonymous with
              sskkiipp=_n.

     oobbss=_n    Set the output block size to _n bytes instead of the default 512.

     ooff=_f_i_l_e  Write output to _f_i_l_e instead of the standard output.  Any regu-
              lar output file is truncated unless the nnoottrruunncc conversion value
              is specified.  If an initial portion of the output file is
              seeked past (see the oosseeeekk operand), the output file is trun-
              cated at that point.

     oosseeeekk=_n  Seek on the output file _n blocks.  This is synonymous with
              sseeeekk=_n.

     sseeeekk=_n   Seek _n blocks from the beginning of the output before copying.
              On non-tape devices, an lseek(2) operation is used.  Otherwise,
              existing blocks are read and the data discarded.  If the user
              does not have read permission for the tape, it is positioned
              using the tape ioctl(2) function calls.  If the seek operation
              is past the end of file, space from the current end of file to
              the specified offset is filled with blocks of NUL bytes.

     sskkiipp=_n   Skip _n blocks from the beginning of the input before copying.
              On input which supports seeks, an lseek(2) operation is used.
              Otherwise, input data is read and discarded.  For pipes, the
              correct number of bytes is read.  For all other devices, the
              correct number of blocks is read without distinguishing between
              a partial or complete block being read.

     ccoonnvv=_v_a_l_u_e[,_v_a_l_u_e _._._.]
              Where vvaalluuee is one of the symbols from the following list.

              aasscciiii, oollddaasscciiii
                       The same as the uunnbblloocckk value except that characters
                       are translated from EBCDIC to ASCII before the records
                       are converted.  (These values imply uunnbblloocckk if the op-
                       erand ccbbss is also specified.)  There are two conversion
                       maps for ASCII.  The value aasscciiii specifies the recom-
                       mended one which is compatible with AT&T System V UNIX.
                       The value oollddaasscciiii specifies the one used in historic
                       AT&T UNIX and pre-4.3BSD-Reno systems.

              bblloocckk    Treats the input as a sequence of newline or end-of-
                       file terminated variable length records independent of
                       input and output block boundaries.  Any trailing new-
                       line character is discarded.  Each input record is con-
                       verted to a fixed length output record where the length
                       is specified by the ccbbss operand.  Input records shorter
                       than the conversion record size are padded with spaces.
                       Input records longer than the conversion record size
                       are truncated.  The number of truncated input records,
                       if any, are reported to the standard error output at
                       the completion of the copy.

              eebbccddiicc, iibbmm, oollddeebbccddiicc, oollddiibbmm
                       The same as the bblloocckk value except that characters are
                       translated from ASCII to EBCDIC after the records are
                       converted.  (These values imply bblloocckk if the operand
                       ccbbss is also specified.)  There are four conversion maps
                       for EBCDIC.  The value eebbccddiicc specifies the recommended
                       one which is compatible with AT&T System V UNIX.  The
                       value iibbmm is a slightly different mapping, which is
                       compatible with the AT&T System V UNIX iibbmm value.  The
                       values oollddeebbccddiicc and oollddiibbmm are maps used in historic
                       AT&T UNIX and pre-4.3BSD-Reno systems.

              llccaassee    Transform uppercase characters into lowercase charac-
                       ters.

              nnooeerrrroorr  Do not stop processing on an input error.  When an
                       input error occurs, a diagnostic message followed by
                       the current input and output block counts will be writ-
                       ten to the standard error output in the same format as
                       the standard completion message.  If the ssyynncc conver-
                       sion is also specified, any missing input data will be
                       replaced with NUL bytes (or with spaces if a block ori-
                       ented conversion value was specified) and processed as
                       a normal input buffer.  If the ssyynncc conversion is not
                       specified, the input block is omitted from the output.
                       On input files which are not tapes or pipes, the file
                       offset will be positioned past the block in which the
                       error occurred using lseek(2).

              nnoottrruunncc  Do not truncate the output file.  This will preserve
                       any blocks in the output file not explicitly written by
                       dddd.  The nnoottrruunncc value is not supported for tapes.

              oossyynncc    Pad the final output block to the full output block
                       size.  If the input file is not a multiple of the out-
                       put block size after conversion, this conversion forces
                       the final output block to be the same size as preceding
                       blocks for use on devices that require regularly sized
                       blocks to be written.  This option is incompatible with
                       use of the bbss=_n block size specification.

              ssppaarrssee   If one or more output blocks would consist solely of
                       NUL bytes, try to seek the output file by the required
                       space instead of filling them with NULs, resulting in a
                       sparse file.

              sswwaabb     Swap every pair of input bytes.  If an input buffer has
                       an odd number of bytes, the last byte will be ignored
                       during swapping.

              ssyynncc     Pad every input block to the input buffer size.  Spaces
                       are used for pad bytes if a block oriented conversion
                       value is specified, otherwise NUL bytes are used.

              uuccaassee    Transform lowercase characters into uppercase charac-
                       ters.

              uunnbblloocckk  Treats the input as a sequence of fixed length records
                       independent of input and output block boundaries.  The
                       length of the input records is specified by the ccbbss op-
                       erand.  Any trailing space characters are discarded and
                       a newline character is appended.

     Where sizes are specified, a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal number of
     bytes is expected.  If the number ends with a ``b'', ``k'', ``m'', ``g'',
     or ``w'', the number is multiplied by 512, 1024 (1K), 1048576 (1M),
     1073741824 (1G) or the number of bytes in an integer, respectively.  Two
     or more numbers may be separated by an ``x'' to indicate a product.

     When finished, dddd displays the number of complete and partial input and
     output blocks, truncated input records and odd-length byte-swapping
     blocks to the standard error output.  A partial input block is one where
     less than the input block size was read.  A partial output block is one
     where less than the output block size was written.  Partial output blocks
     to tape devices are considered fatal errors.  Otherwise, the rest of the
     block will be written.  Partial output blocks to character devices will
     produce a warning message.  A truncated input block is one where a vari-
     able length record oriented conversion value was specified and the input
     line was too long to fit in the conversion record or was not newline ter-
     minated.

     Normally, data resulting from input or conversion or both are aggregated
     into output blocks of the specified size.  After the end of input is
     reached, any remaining output is written as a block.  This means that the
     final output block may be shorter than the output block size.

     If dddd receives a SIGINFO (see the ssttaattuuss argument for stty(1)) signal,
     the current input and output block counts will be written to the standard
     error output in the same format as the standard completion message.  If
     dddd receives a SIGINT signal, the current input and output block counts
     will be written to the standard error output in the same format as the
     standard completion message and dddd will exit.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The uunniittss program converts quantities expressed in various scales to
     their equivalents in other scales.  The uunniittss program can only handle
     multiplicative scale changes.  It cannot convert Celsius to Fahrenheit,
     for example.  It works interactively by prompting the user for input:

         You have: meters
         You want: feet
                 * 3.2808399
                 / 0.3048

         You have: cm^3
         You want: gallons
                 * 0.00026417205
                 / 3785.4118

         You have: meters/s
         You want: furlongs/fortnight
                 * 6012.8848
                 / 0.00016630952

         You have: 1|2 inch
         You want: cm
                 * 1.27
                 / 0.78740157

     Powers of units can be specified using the '^' character as shown in the
     example, or by simple concatenation: 'cm3' is equivalent to 'cm^3'.  Mul-
     tiplication of units can be specified by using spaces, a dash or an
     asterisk.  Division of units is indicated by the slash ('/').  Note that
     multiplication has a higher precedence than division, so 'm/s/s' is the
     same as 'm/s^2' or 'm/s s'.  Division of numbers must be indicated using
     the vertical bar ('|').  To convert half a meter, you would write '1|2
     meter'.  If you write '1/2 meter' then the units program would interpret
     that as equivalent to '0.5/meter'.  If you enter incompatible unit types,
     the units program will print a message indicating that the units are not
     conformable and it will display the reduced form for each unit:

         You have: ergs/hour
         You want: fathoms kg^2 / day
         conformability error
                 2.7777778e-11 kg m^2 / sec^3
                 2.1166667e-05 kg^2 m / sec

     The conversion information is read from a units data file.  The default
     file includes definitions for most familiar units, abbreviations and met-
     ric prefixes.  Some constants of nature included are:

           pi         ratio of circumference to diameter
           c          speed of light
           e          charge on an electron
           g          acceleration of gravity
           force      same as g
           mole       Avogadro's number
           water      pressure per unit height of water
           mercury    pressure per unit height of mercury
           au         astronomical unit

     The unit 'pound' is a unit of mass.  Compound names are run together so
     'pound force' is a unit of force.  The unit 'ounce' is also a unit of
     mass.  The fluid ounce is 'floz'.  British units that differ from their
     US counterparts are prefixed with 'br', and currency is prefixed with its
     country name: 'belgiumfranc', 'britainpound'.  When searching for a unit,
     if the specified string does not appear exactly as a unit name, then
     uunniittss will try to remove a trailing 's' or a trailing 'es' and check
     again for a match.

     To find out what units are available read the standard units file.  If
     you want to add your own units you can supply your own file.  A unit is
     specified on a single line by giving its name and an equivalence.  Be
     careful to define new units in terms of old ones so that a reduction
     leads to the primitive units which are marked with '!' characters.  The
     uunniittss program will not detect infinite loops that could be caused by
     careless unit definitions.  Comments in the unit definition file begin
     with a '/' character at the beginning of a line.

     Prefixes are defined in the same was as standard units, but with a trail-
     ing dash at the end of the prefix name.  If a unit is not found even
     after removing trailing 's' or 'es', then it will be checked against the
     list of prefixes.  Prefixes will be removed until a legal base unit is
     identified.

     Here is an example of a short units file that defines some basic units.

           m         !a!
           sec       !b!
           micro-    1e-6
           minute    60 sec
           hour      60 min
           inch      0.0254 m

           mile      5280 ft

     The effect of including a '/' in a prefix is surprising.

     Exponents entered by the user can be only one digit.  You can work around
     this by multiplying several terms.

     The user must use | to indicate division of numbers and / to indicate
     division of symbols.  This distinction should not be necessary.

     The program contains various arbitrary limits on the length of the units
     converted and on the length of the data file.

     The program should use a hash table to store units so that it does not
     take so long to load the units list and check for duplication.

       ppbbccooppyy  takes  the standard input and places it in the specified paste-
       board. If no pasteboard is specified, the general  pasteboard  will  be
       used  by  default.  The input is placed in the pasteboard as plain text
       data unless it begins  with  the  Encapsulated  PostScript  (EPS)  file
       header  or  the Rich Text Format (RTF) file header, in which case it is
       placed in the pasteboard as one of those data types.

       ppbbppaassttee removes the data from the pasteboard and writes it to the stan-
       dard output.  It normally looks first for plain text data in the paste-
       board and writes that to the standard output; if no plain text data  is
       in  the  pasteboard  it looks for Encapsulated PostScript; if no EPS is
       present it looks for Rich Text.  If none of those types is  present  in
       the pasteboard, ppbbppaassttee produces no output.

       * Encoding:

       ppbbccooppyy  and  ppbbppaassttee  use locale environment variables to determine the
       encoding to be used for input and output.  For  example,  absent  other
       locale settings, setting the environment variable LANG=en_US.UTF-8 will
       cause ppbbccooppyy and ppbbppaassttee to use UTF-8 for  input  and  output.   If  an
       encoding  cannot be determined from the locale, the standard C encoding
       will be used.  Use of UTF-8 is recommended.  Note that by  default  the
       Terminal application uses the UTF-8 encoding and automatically sets the
       appropriate locale environment variable.

              first.   As stated above, ppbbppaassttee normally looks first for plain
              text data; however,  by  specifying  --PPrreeffeerr  ppss  you  can  tell
              ppbbppaassttee to look first for Encapsulated PostScript.  If you spec-
              ify --PPrreeffeerr rrttff, ppbbppaassttee looks first for Rich Text  format.   In
              any  case,  ppbbppaassttee looks for the other formats if the preferred
              one is not found.  The txt option replaces the deprecated  ascii
              option,  which continues to function as before.  Both indicate a
              preference for plain text.

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       xxssllttpprroocc is a command line tool for applying XSLT stylesheets to XML
       documents. It is part of lliibbxxsslltt(3), the XSLT C library for GNOME.
       While it was developed as part of the GNOME project, it can operate
       independently of the GNOME desktop.


       xxssllttpprroocc is invoked from the command line with the name of the
       stylesheet to be used followed by the name of the file or files to
       which the stylesheet is to be applied. It will use the standard input
       if a filename provided is --

       If a stylesheet is included in an XML document with a Stylesheet
       Processing Instruction, no stylesheet need to be named at the command
       line.  xxssllttpprroocc will automatically detect the included stylesheet and
       use it.

       By default, output is to _s_t_d_o_u_t. You can specify a file for output
       using the --oo or ----oouuttppuutt option.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       xxssllttpprroocc accepts the following options (in alphabetical order):

       ----ccaattaallooggss
           Use the SGML catalog specified in SSGGMMLL__CCAATTAALLOOGG__FFIILLEESS to resolve the
           location of external entities. By default, xxssllttpprroocc looks for the
           catalog specified in XXMMLL__CCAATTAALLOOGG__FFIILLEESS. If that is not specified,
           it uses _/_e_t_c_/_x_m_l_/_c_a_t_a_l_o_g.

       ----ddeebbuugg
           Output an XML tree of the transformed document for debugging
           purposes.

       ----dduummppeexxtteennssiioonnss
           Dumps the list of all registered extensions on _s_t_d_o_u_t.

       ----hhttmmll
           The input document is an HTML file.

       ----llooaadd--ttrraaccee
           Display all the documents loaded during the processing to _s_t_d_e_r_r.

       ----mmaaxxddeepptthh _V_A_L_U_E
           Adjust the maximum depth of the template stack before lliibbxxsslltt(3)
           concludes it is in an infinite loop. The default is 3000.

       ----nnooddttddaattttrr
           Do not apply default attributes from the document's DTD.

       ----nnoommkkddiirr
           Refuses to create directories.

       ----nnoonneett
           Do not use the Internet to fetch DTDs, entities or documents.

       ----nnoooouutt
           Do not output the result.

       ----nnoovvaalliidd
           Skip loading the document's DTD.

       ----nnoowwrriittee
           Refuses to write to any file or resource.

       --oo or ----oouuttppuutt _F_I_L_E | _D_I_R_E_C_T_O_R_Y
           Direct output to the given _F_I_L_E. Using the option with a _D_I_R_E_C_T_O_R_Y
           directs the output files to the specified directory. This can be
           useful for multiple outputs (also known as ""chunking"") or manpage
           processing.

           Important
           The given directory mmuusstt already exist.

           Note
           Make sure that _F_I_L_E and _D_I_R_E_C_T_O_R_Y follow the ""URI reference
           computation"" as described in RFC 2396 and laters. This means, that
           e.g.  --oo ddiirreeccttoorryy will maybe not work, but --oo ddiirreeccttoorryy// will.

       ----eennccooddiinngg _E_N_C_O_D_I_N_G
           Allow to specify the encoding for the input.

       ----ppaarraamm _P_A_R_A_M_N_A_M_E _P_A_R_A_M_V_A_L_U_E
           Pass a parameter of name _P_A_R_A_M_N_A_M_E and value _P_A_R_A_M_V_A_L_U_E to the
           stylesheet. You may pass multiple name/value pairs up to a maximum
           of 32. If the value being passed is a string, you can use
           ----ssttrriinnggppaarraamm instead, to avoid additional quote characters that
           appear in string expressions. Note: the XPath expression must be
           UTF-8 encoded.

       ----ppaatthh """"_P_A_T_H_(_S_)""""
           Use the (space- or colon-separated) list of filesystem paths
           specified by _P_A_T_H_S to load DTDs, entities or documents. Enclose
           space-separated lists by quotation marks.

       ----pprrooffiillee or ----nnoorrmmaann
           Output profiling information detailing the amount of time spent in
           each part of the stylesheet. This is useful in optimizing
           stylesheet performance.

       ----rreeppeeaatt
           Run the transformation 20 times. Used for timing tests.

       ----ssttrriinnggppaarraamm _P_A_R_A_M_N_A_M_E _P_A_R_A_M_V_A_L_U_E
           Pass a parameter of name _P_A_R_A_M_N_A_M_E and value _P_A_R_A_M_V_A_L_U_E where
           _P_A_R_A_M_V_A_L_U_E is a string rather than a node identifier.  NNoottee:: The
           string must be UTF-8 encoded.

       ----ttiimmiinngg
           Display the time used for parsing the stylesheet, parsing the
           document and applying the stylesheet and saving the result.
           Displayed in milliseconds.

       --vv or ----vveerrbboossee
           Output each step taken by xxssllttpprroocc in processing the stylesheet and
           the document.

       --VV or ----vveerrssiioonn
           Show the version of lliibbxxmmll(3) and lliibbxxsslltt(3) used.

       ----wwrriitteessuubbttrreeee _P_A_T_H
           Allow file write only within the _P_A_T_H subtree.

       ----xxiinncclluuddee
           Process the input document using the XInclude specification. More
           details on this can be found in the XInclude specification:
           _h_t_t_p_:_/_/_w_w_w_._w_3_._o_r_g_/_T_R_/_x_i_n_c_l_u_d_e_/

           SGML catalog behavior can be changed by redirecting queries to the

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     In its first form, ddiittttoo copies one or more source files or directories
     to a destination directory.  If the destination directory does not exist
     it will be created before the first source is copied.  If the destination
     directory already exists then the source directories are merged with the
     previous contents of the destination.

     In its second form, ddiittttoo copies a file to the supplied _d_s_t___f_i_l_e path-
     name.

     The next two forms reflect ddiittttoo's ability to create and extract ar-
     chives.  These archives can be either CPIO format (preferred for unix
     content) or PKZip (for Windows compatibility).  _s_r_c___a_r_c_h_i_v_e (and
     _d_s_t___a_r_c_h_i_v_e) can be the single character '-', causing ditto to read
     (write) archive data from stdin (or to stdout, respectively).

     ddiittttoo follows symbolic links provided as arguments but does not follow
     any links as it traverses the source or destination hierarchies.  ddiittttoo
     overwrites existing files, symbolic links, and devices in the destination
     when these are copied from a source.  The resulting files, links, and
     devices will have the same mode, access time, modification time, owner,
     and group as the source items from which they are copied.  Pipes, sock-
     ets, and files with names beginning with .nfs or .afpDeleted will be
     ignored.  ddiittttoo does not modify the mode, owner, group, extended
     attributes, or ACLs of existing directories in the destination.  Files
     and symbolic links cannot overwrite directories or vice-versa.

     ddiittttoo can be used to ""thin"" Universal Mach-O binaries during a copy.
     ddiittttoo can also copy files selectively based on the contents of a BOM
     (""Bill of Materials"") file.  ddiittttoo preserves file hard links (but not
     directory hard links) present in the source directories and preserves
     setuid and setgid modes when run as the superuser.

     ddiittttoo will preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data information when
     copying unless instructed otherwise using ----nnoorrssrrcc .  Similarly, ddiittttoo
     will preserve extended attributes and Access Control Lists (ACLs) unless
     ----nnooeexxttaattttrr or ----nnooaaccll is passed.  DITTONORSRC can be set in the environ-
     ment as an alias to ----nnoorrssrrcc ----nnooeexxttaattttrr ----nnooaaccll on the command line.

                   format is CPIO, unless --kk is given.  CPIO archives should
                   be stored in files with names ending in .cpio.  Compressed
                   CPIO archives should be stored in files with names ending

                   will take precedence.  Both options override DITTONORSRC.
                   Unless explicitly specified, ----nnoorrssrrcc also implies

                   This is only supported on Mac OS X 10.6 or later, and is
                   only intended to be used in installation and backup scenar-

                   pression are not readable on versions of Mac OS X earlier
                   than 10.6, this flag should not be used when dealing with
                   non-system files or other user-generated content that will

     The command:
           ditto src_directory dir/dst_directory
     copies the contents of src_directory into dir/dst_directory, creating dir
     and dst_directory if they don't already exist.

     The command:
           ditto src-1 ... src-n dst_directory
     copies the contents of all of the src directories into dst_directory,

     code to ppc-only on the fly.

     The command:
           ditto -c --norsrc Scripts -|ssh rhost ditto -x --norsrc - ./Scripts
     copies Scripts, skipping any resources or meta-data, to rhost.

     The command:

     will copy the contents of foo into bar, whereas
           cp -r foo bar
     copies foo itself into bar. Though this is not a bug, some may consider
     this bug-like behavior.  ----kkeeeeppPPaarreenntt for non-archive copies will eventu-

     The ssttttyy utility sets or reports on terminal characteristics for the
     device that is its standard input.  If no options or operands are speci-
     fied, it reports the settings of a subset of characteristics as well as
     additional ones if they differ from their default values.  Otherwise it
     modifies the terminal state according to the specified arguments.  Some
     combinations of arguments are mutually exclusive on some terminal types.

     The following options are available:

     --aa      Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard
             output as per IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'').

     --ee      Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard
             output in the traditional BSD ``all'' and ``everything'' formats.

     --ff      Open and use the terminal named by _f_i_l_e rather than using stan-
             dard input.  The file is opened using the O_NONBLOCK flag of
             ooppeenn(), making it possible to set or display settings on a termi-
             nal that might otherwise block on the open.

     --gg      Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard
             output in a form that may be used as an argument to a subsequent
             invocation of ssttttyy to restore the current terminal state as per
             IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'').

                 The system imposes a limit of MAX_INPUT (currently 255) char-
                 acters in the input queue.  If iimmaaxxbbeell is set and the input
                 queue limit has been reached, subsequent input causes the
                 system to send an ASCII BEL character to the output queue
                 (the terminal beeps at you).  Otherwise, if iimmaaxxbbeell is unset
                 and the input queue is full, the next input character causes
                 the entire input and output queues to be discarded.

     iinnllccrr (--iinnllccrr)
                 Map (do not map) NL to CR on input.

                 Request that the system send (not send) START/STOP characters
                 when the input queue is nearly empty/full.

     iixxoonn (--iixxoonn)
                 Enable (disable) START/STOP output control.  Output from the
                 system is stopped when the system receives STOP and started
                 when the system receives START, or if iixxaannyy is set, any char-
                 acter restarts output.

   LLooccaall MMooddeess::
     Local mode flags (lflags) affect various and sundry characteristics of
     terminal processing.  Historically the term ""local"" pertained to new job
     control features implemented by Jim Kulp on a Pdp 11/70 at IIASA.  Later,
     the driver ran on the first VAX at Evans Hall, UC Berkeley, where the job
     control details were greatly modified, but the structure definitions and
     names remained essentially unchanged.  The second interpretation of the
     'l' in lflag is ``line discipline flag'', which corresponds to the
     _c___l_f_l_a_g of the _t_e_r_m_i_o_s structure.

                 Use (do not use) an alternate word erase algorithm when pro-
                 cessing WERASE characters.  This alternate algorithm consid-
                 ers sequences of alphanumeric/underscores as words.  It also
                 skips the first preceding character in its classification (as
                 a convenience, since the one preceding character could have
                 been erased with simply an ERASE character.)

     eecchhoo (--eecchhoo)

                 If eecchhooccttll is set, echo control characters as ^X.  Otherwise,
                 control characters echo as themselves.

     eecchhooee (--eecchhooee)
                 The ERASE character shall (shall not) visually erase the last

     eecchhoopprrtt (--eecchhoopprrtt)
                 For printing terminals.  If set, echo erased characters back-
                 wards within ``\'' and ``/''.  Otherwise, disable this fea-
                 ture.

                 If set, flow control output based on condition of Carrier
                 Detect.  Otherwise, writes return an error if Carrier Detect
                 is low (and Carrier is not being ignored with the CLOCAL
                 flag.)

     nnooffllsshh (--nnooffllsshh)

     ppeennddiinn (--ppeennddiinn)
                 Indicates input is (is not) pending after a switch from non-

     ddeecc         Set modes suitable for users of Digital Equipment Corporation
                 systems (ERASE, KILL, and INTR characters are set to ^?, ^U,
                 and ^C; ixany is disabled, and crt is enabled.)

     kkeerrnniinnffoo (--kkeerrnniinnffoo)
                 Enable (disable) the system generated status line associated
                 with processing a STATUS character (usually set to ^T).  The
                 status line consists of the system load average, the current
                 command name, its process ID, the event the process is wait-
                 ing on (or the status of the process), the user and system

     rraaww (--rraaww)  If set, change the modes of the terminal so that no input or
                 output processing is performed.  If unset, change the modes
                 of the terminal to some reasonable state that performs input
                 and output processing.  Note that since the terminal driver
                 no longer has a single RAW bit, it is not possible to intuit
                 what flags were set prior to setting rraaww.  This means that
                 unsetting rraaww may not put back all the setting that were pre-
                 viously in effect.  To set the terminal into a raw state and
                 then accurately restore it, the following shell code is rec-
                 ommended:

                 save_state=$(stty -g)
                 stty raw

     Software Update checks for new and updated versions of your software
     based on information about your computer and current software.

     Invoke ssooffttwwaarreeuuppddaattee by specifying a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d followed by zero or more
     _a_r_g_s.

     ssooffttwwaarreeuuppddaattee requires admin authentication for all commands except
     ----lliisstt.  If you run ssooffttwwaarreeuuppddaattee as a normal admin user, you will be
     prompted for a password where required. Alternatively, you can run
     ssooffttwwaarreeuuppddaattee as root and avoid all further authentication prompts.

     The following _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s are available:

     --ll | ----lliisstt
                 List all available updates.

     --ii | ----iinnssttaallll
                 Each update specified by _a_r_g_s is downloaded and installed.
                 _a_r_g_s can be one of the following:

                 _-_r | _-_-_r_e_c_o_m_m_e_n_d_e_d
                             All updates that are recommended for your system.
                             These are prefixed with a _* character in the
                             ----lliisstt output.

                 _-_R | _-_-_r_e_s_t_a_r_t

                             to complete installation. If the user invoking
                             this tool is logged in then macOS will attempt to
                             quit all applications, logout, and restart. If
                             the user is not logged in, macOS will trigger a
                             forced reboot if necessary. If you wish to always
                             perform a forced reboot, pass --force.

                 _-_a | _-_-_a_l_l  All updates that are applicable to your system,
                             including those non-recommended ones, which are
                             prefixed with a _- character in the ----lliisstt output.
                             (Non-recommended updates are uncommon in any
                             case.)

                 _i_t_e_m _._._.    One or more specified updates. The ----lliisstt output
                             shows the item names you can specify here, pre-

     --dd | ----ddoowwnnllooaadd
                 Each update specified by _a_r_g_s is downloaded but not
                 installed. The values of _a_r_g_s are the same as for the
                 ----iinnssttaallll command. Updates downloaded with ----ddoowwnnllooaadd can be
                 subsequently installed with ----iinnssttaallll, or through the App
                 Store (as long as they remain applicable to your system).
                 Updates are downloaded to _/_L_i_b_r_a_r_y_/_U_p_d_a_t_e_s, but are not
                 designed to be installed by double-clicking the packages in
                 that directory: always use ----iinnssttaallll or the App Store to

                 simple shell globbing. A dot (.) matches any character, while
                 '*' matches zero or more of the previous character. See

       ppbbccooppyy  takes  the standard input and places it in the specified paste-
       board. If no pasteboard is specified, the general  pasteboard  will  be
       used  by  default.  The input is placed in the pasteboard as plain text
       data unless it begins  with  the  Encapsulated  PostScript  (EPS)  file
       header  or  the Rich Text Format (RTF) file header, in which case it is
       placed in the pasteboard as one of those data types.

       ppbbppaassttee removes the data from the pasteboard and writes it to the stan-
       dard output.  It normally looks first for plain text data in the paste-
       board and writes that to the standard output; if no plain text data  is
       in  the  pasteboard  it looks for Encapsulated PostScript; if no EPS is
       present it looks for Rich Text.  If none of those types is  present  in
       the pasteboard, ppbbppaassttee produces no output.

       * Encoding:

       ppbbccooppyy  and  ppbbppaassttee  use locale environment variables to determine the
       encoding to be used for input and output.  For  example,  absent  other
       locale settings, setting the environment variable LANG=en_US.UTF-8 will
       cause ppbbccooppyy and ppbbppaassttee to use UTF-8 for  input  and  output.   If  an
       encoding  cannot be determined from the locale, the standard C encoding
       will be used.  Use of UTF-8 is recommended.  Note that by  default  the
       Terminal application uses the UTF-8 encoding and automatically sets the
       appropriate locale environment variable.

BBUUGGSS
     The notion of the ``current process'' is muddy.  The current algorithm is
     ``the highest numbered process on the terminal that is not ignoring
     interrupts, or, if there is none, the highest numbered process on the
     terminal''.  This fails, for example, in critical sections of programs
     like the shell and editor, or when faulty programs running in the back-
     ground fork and fail to ignore interrupts.  (In cases where no process
     can be found, ww prints ``-''.)

     The CPU time is only an estimate, in particular, if someone leaves a
     background process running after logging out, the person currently on
     that terminal is ``charged'' with the time.

     Background processes are not shown, even though they account for much of
     the load on the system.

     Sometimes processes, typically those in the background, are printed with
     null or garbaged arguments.  In these cases, the name of the command is
     printed in parentheses.

     The ww utility does not know about the new conventions for detection of
     background jobs.  It will sometimes find a background job instead of the
     right one.

     Long hostnames and IPv6 addresses may be truncated; however, the who(1)
     utility will display full hostnames.

- Print files and directories up to 'num' levels of depth (where 1 means the current directory):

`tree -L {{num}}`

- Print directories only:

`tree -d`

- Print hidden files too with colorization on:

`tree -a -C`

- Print the tree without indentation lines, showing the full path instead (use `-N` to not escape whitespace and special characters):

`tree -i -f`

- Print the size of each node next to it, in human-readable format, with directories displaying their cumulative size (as in the `du` command):

`tree -s -h --du`

- Print files within the tree hierarchy, using a wildcard (glob) pattern, and pruning out directories that don't contain matching files:

`tree -P '{{*.txt}}' --prune`

- Print directories within the tree hierarchy, using the wildcard (glob) pattern, and pruning out directories that aren't ancestors of the wanted one:

`tree -P {{directory_name}} --matchdirs --prune`

- Print the tree ignoring the given directories:

`tree -I '{{directory_name1|directory_name2}}'`

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _T_r_e_e  is  a  recursive  directory listing program that produces a depth
       indented listing of files, which is  colorized  ala  _d_i_r_c_o_l_o_r_s  if  the
       LLSS__CCOOLLOORRSS  environment  variable  is set and output is to tty.  With no
       arguments, _t_r_e_e lists the files in the current directory.  When  direc-
       tory  arguments  are given, _t_r_e_e lists all the files and/or directories
       found in the given directories each in turn.  Upon completion of  list-
       ing all files/directories found, _t_r_e_e returns the total number of files
       and/or directories listed.

       By default, when a symbolic link is encountered, the path that the sym-
       bolic  link refers to is printed after the name of the link in the for-
       mat:

           name -> real-path

       If the `--ll' option is given and the symbolic link refers to  an  actual
       directory, then _t_r_e_e will follow the path of the symbolic link as if it
       were a real directory.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _T_r_e_e understands the following command line switches:


LLIISSTTIINNGG OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aa     All files are printed.  By default tree does  not  print  hidden
              files  (those  beginning with a dot `.').  In no event does tree
              print the file system constructs  `.'  (current  directory)  and
              `..' (previous directory).


       --dd     List directories only.


       --ll     Follows  symbolic links if they point to directories, as if they
              were directories. Symbolic links that will result  in  recursion
              are avoided when detected.


       --ff     Prints the full path prefix for each file.


       --xx     Stay on the current file-system only.  Ala ffiinndd _-_x_d_e_v..


       --LL _l_e_v_e_l
              Max display depth of the directory tree.


       --RR     Recursively  cross  down the tree each _l_e_v_e_l directories (see --LL
              option), and at each of  them  execute  ttrreeee  again  adding  `-o
              00Tree.html' as a new option.


       --PP _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              List  only  those files that match the wild-card _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  Note:
              you must use the _-_a option to also consider those  files  begin-
              ning with a dot `.'  for matching.  Valid wildcard operators are
              `*' (any zero or more characters), `?' (any  single  character),
              `[...]'  (any single character listed between brackets (optional
              - (dash) for character  range  may  be  used:  ex:  [A-Z]),  and
              `[^...]'  (any  single character not listed in brackets) and `|'
              separates alternate patterns.


       --II _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Do not list those files that match the wild-card _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.


       ----iiggnnoorree--ccaassee
              If a match pattern is specified by the --PP  or  --II  option,  this
              will  cause  the pattern to match without regards to the case of
              each letter.


       ----mmaattcchhddiirrss
              If a match pattern is specified by  the  --PP  option,  this  will
              cause  the pattern to be applied to directory names (in addition
              to filenames).  In the event of a match on the  directory  name,
              matching  is  disabled  for  the  directory's  contents.  If the
              ----pprruunnee option is used, empty folders  that  match  the  pattern
              will not be pruned.


       ----pprruunnee
              Makes  tree prune empty directories from the output, useful when
              used in conjunction with --PP or --II.  See BBUUGGSS AANNDD NNOOTTEESS below for
              more information on this option.


       ----nnoorreeppoorrtt
              Omits  printing  of  the file and directory report at the end of
              the tree listing.


       ----cchhaarrsseett _c_h_a_r_s_e_t
              Set the character set to use when outputting HTML and  for  line
              drawing.


       ----ffiilleelliimmiitt _#
              Do not descend directories that contain more than _# entries.


       ----ttiimmeeffmmtt _f_o_r_m_a_t
              Prints (implies -D) and formats the date according to the format
              string which uses the ssttrrffttiimmee(3) syntax.


       --oo _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Send output to _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.



FFIILLEE OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --qq     Print non-printable characters in filenames  as  question  marks
              instead of the default.


       --NN     Print non-printable characters as is instead of as escaped octal
              numbers.


       --QQ     Quote the names of files in double quotes.


       --pp     Print the file type and permissions for each  file  (as  per  ls
              -l).


       --uu     Print the username, or UID # if no username is available, of the
              file.


       --gg     Print the group name, or GID # if no group name is available, of
              the file.


       --ss     Print the size of each file in bytes along with the name.


       --hh     Print  the  size  of each file but in a more human readable way,
              e.g. appending a size letter for kilobytes (K),  megabytes  (M),
              gigabytes (G), terabytes (T), petabytes (P) and exabytes (E).


       ----ssii   Like --hh but use SI units (powers of 1000) instead.


       ----dduu   For  each directory report its size as the accumulation of sizes
              of all its files and sub-directories (and their  files,  and  so
              on).   The total amount of used space is also given in the final
              report (like the 'du -c' command.) This option requires tree  to
              read  the entire directory tree before emitting it, see BBUUGGSS AANNDD
              NNOOTTEESS below.  Implies --ss.


       --DD     Print the date of the last modification time or if --cc  is  used,
              the last status change time for the file listed.


       --FF     Append  a `/' for directories, a `=' for socket files, a `*' for
              executable files, a `>'  for  doors  (Solaris)  and  a  `|'  for
              FIFO's, as per ls -F


       ----iinnooddeess
              Prints the inode number of the file or directory


       ----ddeevviiccee
              Prints the device number to which the file or directory belongs



SSOORRTTIINNGG OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --vv     Sort the output by version.


       --tt     Sort  the output by last modification time instead of alphabeti-
              cally.


       --cc     Sort the output by last status change instead of alphabetically.
              Modifies the --DD option (if used) to print the last status change
              instead of modification time.


       --UU     Do not sort.  Lists files in directory order.  Disables  ----ddiirrss--
              ffiirrsstt.


       --rr     Sort  the  output  in  reverse  order.  This is a meta-sort that
              alter the above sorts.  This option is disabled when --UU is used.


       ----ddiirrssffiirrsstt
              List  directories  before files. This is a meta-sort that alters

              Sort the output by _t_y_p_e instead of name.  Possible  values  are:
              ccttiimmee (--cc), mmttiimmee (--tt)),, ssiizzee, or vveerrssiioonn (--vv))..


GGRRAAPPHHIICCSS OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --ii     Makes  tree not print the indentation lines, useful when used in
              conjunction with the --ff option.  Also removes as much whitespace
              as possible when used with the --JJ or --xx options.


       --AA     Turn  on  ANSI  line graphics hack when printing the indentation
              lines.


       --SS     Turn on CP437 line graphics (useful  when  using  Linux  console
              mode fonts). This option is now equivalent to `--charset=IBM437'
              and may eventually be depreciated.


       --nn     Turn colorization off always, over-ridden by the --CC option.


       --CC     Turn colorization on always, using built-in  color  defaults  if
              the  LS_COLORS or TREE_COLORS environment variables are not set.
              Useful to colorize output to a pipe.

       --XX     Turn on XML output. Outputs the directory tree as an XML format-
              ted file.


       --JJ     Turn  on JSON output. Outputs the directory tree as an JSON for-
              matted array.


       --HH _b_a_s_e_H_R_E_F
              Turn on HTML output, including HTTP references. Useful  for  ftp
              sites.   _b_a_s_e_H_R_E_F  gives  the  base ftp location when using HTML
              output. That is, the local directory  may  be  `/local/ftp/pub',
              but   it   must   be   referenced  as  `ftp://hostname.organiza-
              tion.domain/pub' (_b_a_s_e_H_R_E_F should  be  `ftp://hostname.organiza-
              tion.domain').  Hint: don't use ANSI lines with this option, and
              don't give more than one directory in the directory list. If you
              wish  to  use  colors  via CSS style-sheet, use the -C option in
              addition to this option to force color output.


       --TT _t_i_t_l_e

       Tree does not prune ""empty"" directories when the -P and -I options  are
       used by default. Use the --prune option.

       The -h and --si options round to the nearest whole number unlike the ls
       implementations which rounds up always.

       Pruning files and directories with the -I, -P and  --filelimit  options
       will lead to incorrect file/directory count reports.

       The  --prune  and --du options cause tree to accumulate the entire tree
       in memory before emitting it. For large directory trees this can  cause
       a significant delay in output and the use of large amounts of memory.

       The  timefmt  expansion  buffer  is limited to a ridiculously large 255
       characters.  Output of time strings longer than this will be undefined,
       but are guaranteed to not exceed 255 characters.

       XML/JSON trees are not colored, which is a bit of a shame.

       Probably more.

     --hh      The system is halted at the specified _t_i_m_e.

     --kk      Kick everybody off.  The --kk option does not actually halt the
             system, but leaves the system multi-user with logins disabled
             (for all but super-user).

     --nn      If the --oo is specified, prevent the file system cache from being
             flushed by passing --nn option to halt(8) or reboot(8).  This
             option should probably not be used.

     --oo      If --hh or --rr is specified, sshhuuttddoowwnn will execute halt(8) or
             reboot(8) instead of sending a signal to launchd(8).

     --rr      The system is rebooted at the specified _t_i_m_e.

     --ss      The system is put to sleep at the specified _t_i_m_e.

     --uu      The system is halted up until the point of removing system power,
             but waits before removing power for 5 minutes so that an external
             UPS (uninterruptible power supply) can forcibly remove power.
             This simulates a dirty shutdown to permit a later automatic power
             on. OS X uses this mode automatically with supported UPSs in
             emergency shutdowns.

     _t_i_m_e    _T_i_m_e is the time at which sshhuuttddoowwnn will bring the system down and
             may be the word _n_o_w (indicating an immediate shutdown) or specify
             a future time in one of two formats: _+_n_u_m_b_e_r, or _y_y_m_m_d_d_h_h_m_m,
             where the year, month, and day may be defaulted to the current
             system values.  The first form brings the system down in _n_u_m_b_e_r
             minutes and the second at the absolute time specified.

     _w_a_r_n_i_n_g_-_m_e_s_s_a_g_e
             Any other arguments comprise the warning message that is broad-
             cast to users currently logged into the system.

     --       If `--' is supplied as an option, the warning message is read from
             the standard input.

     At intervals, becoming more frequent as apocalypse approaches and start-
     ing at ten hours before shutdown, warning messages are displayed on the
     terminals of all users logged in.

     At shutdown time a message is written to the system log, containing the
     time of shutdown, the person who initiated the shutdown and the reason.
     Corresponding signal is then sent to launchd(8) to respectively halt,
     reboot or bring the system down to single-user state (depending on the
     above options).

     A scheduled shutdown can be canceled by killing the sshhuuttddoowwnn process (a
     SIGTERM should suffice).

SSIIGGTTEERRMM TTOO SSIIGGKKIILLLL IINNTTEERRVVAALL
     Upon shutdown, all running processes are sent a SIGTERM followed by a
     SIGKILL.  The SIGKILL will follow the SIGTERM by an intentionally inde-
     terminate period of time.  Programs are expected to take only enough time
     to flush all dirty data and exit.  Developers are encouraged to file a
     bug with the OS vendor, should they encounter an issue with this func-
     tionality.

       xxccooddee--sseelleecctt  controls  the location of the developer directory used by
       _x_c_r_u_n_(_1_), _x_c_o_d_e_b_u_i_l_d_(_1_), _c_c_(_1_), and other  Xcode  and  BSD  development
       tools. This also controls the locations that are searched for by _m_a_n_(_1_)
       for developer tool manpages.

       This allows you to easily switch  between  different  versions  of  the
       Xcode  tools  and  can be used to update the path to the Xcode if it is
       moved after installation.

       //AApppplliiccaattiioonnss//XXccooddee..aapppp,  containing  the  latest  Xcode, and //AApppplliiccaa--

       line developer tools.

       After setting a developer directory, all of the  xxccooddee--sseelleecctt  provided
       developer  tool shims (see _F_I_L_E_S) will automatically invoke the version
       of the tool inside the selected developer directory. Your own  scripts,
       makefiles, and other tools can also use _x_c_r_u_n_(_1_) to easily lookup tools
       inside the active developer directory, making it easy  to  switch  them
       between  different  versions  of  the  Xcode tools and allowing them to
       function properly on systems  where  the  Xcode  application  has  been
       installed to a non-default location.

              on the system. To set the path without superuser permissions  or
              only  for the current shell session, use the DEVELOPER_DIR envi-
              ronment variable instead (see _E_N_V_I_R_O_N_M_E_N_T).

              This  is  useful  for  inspection,  but  scripts and other tools
              should use _x_c_r_u_n_(_1_) to locate tool inside the  active  developer

       DEVELOPER_DIR
          Overrides the active developer directory. When DEVELOPER_DIR is set,
          its value will be used instead of the system-wide  active  developer
          directory.

          Note  that for historical reason, the developer directory is consid-
          ered to be the Developer content directory inside the Xcode applica-
          tion  (for  example //AApppplliiccaattiioonnss//XXccooddee..aapppp//CCoonntteennttss//DDeevveellooppeerr). You
          can set the environment variable to either the actual Developer con-
          tents   directory,   or  the  Xcode  application  directory  --  the
          xxccooddee--sseelleecctt provided shims will automatically convert the  environ-

     The dduu utility displays the file system block usage for each file argu-
     ment and for each directory in the file hierarchy rooted in each direc-
     tory argument.  If no file is specified, the block usage of the hierarchy
     rooted in the current directory is displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa      Display an entry for each file in a file hierarchy.

     --cc      Display a grand total.

     --dd _d_e_p_t_h

             deep.

     --HH      Symbolic links on the command line are followed, symbolic links
             in file hierarchies are not followed.

     --hh      ""Human-readable"" output.  Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte,
             Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte.

     --II _m_a_s_k
             Ignore files and directories matching the specified _m_a_s_k.

     --gg      Display block counts in 1073741824-byte (1-Gbyte) blocks.

     --kk      Display block counts in 1024-byte (1-Kbyte) blocks.

     --LL      Symbolic links on the command line and in file hierarchies are
             followed.

     --mm      Display block counts in 1048576-byte (1-Mbyte) blocks.

     --PP      No symbolic links are followed.  This is the default.

     --rr      Generate messages about directories that cannot be read, files
             that cannot be opened, and so on.  This is the default case.
             This option exists solely for conformance with X/Open Portability
             Guide Issue 4 (``XPG4'').

     --ss      Display an entry for each specified file.  (Equivalent to --dd 0)

     --xx      File system mount points are not traversed.

     The dduu utility counts the storage used by symbolic links and not the
     files they reference unless the --HH or --LL option is specified.  If either
     the --HH or --LL options are specified, storage used by any symbolic links
     which are followed is not counted or displayed.  If more than one of the
     --HH, --LL, and --PP options is specified, the last one given is used.

     Files having multiple hard links are counted (and displayed) a single
     time per dduu execution.  Directories having multiple hard links (typically
     Time Machine backups) are counted a single time per dduu execution.

     BLOCKSIZE  If the environment variable BLOCKSIZE is set, and the --kk
                option is not specified, the block counts will be displayed in
                units of that size block.  If BLOCKSIZE is not set, and the --kk
                option is not specified, the block counts will be displayed in
                512-byte blocks.

     The nneettwwoorrkksseettuupp command is used to configure network settings typically
     configured in the System Preferences application. The nneettwwoorrkksseettuupp com-
     mand requires at least admin privileges to change network settings. If
     the ""Require an administrator password to access system-wide preferences""
     option is selected in System Preferences > Security & Privacy, then root
     privileges are required to change network settings.

     Any flag that takes a password will accept ""-"" in place of the password
     to indicate it should read the password from stdin.

     A list of flags and their descriptions:

> Add messages to syslog (/var/log/syslog).

- Log a message to syslog:

`logger {{message}}`

- Take input from `stdin` and log to syslog:

`echo {{log_entry}} | logger`

- Send the output to a remote syslog server running at a given port. Default port is 514:

`echo {{log_entry}} | logger -h {{hostname}} -P {{port}}`

- Use a specific tag for every line logged. Default is the name of logged in user:

`echo {{log_entry}} | logger -t {{tag}}`

- Log messages with a given priority. Default is `user.notice`. See `man logger` for all priority options:

`echo {{log_entry}} | logger -p {{user.warning}}`

              be specified numerically or as a ``facility.level'' pair.  For
              example, ``-p local3.info'' logs the message(s) as _i_n_f_ormational

     Command line option specifications are processed from left to right.

     specified, later specifications override earlier ones.  This makes it
     viable to create a shell alias for ttoopp with preferred defaults specified,
     then override those preferred defaults as desired on the command line.

     --cc _m_o_d_e
             Set event counting mode to _m_o_d_e.  The supported modes are

             a       Accumulative mode.  Count events cumulatively, starting
                     at the launch of ttoopp.  Calculate CPU usage and CPU time
                     since the launch of ttoopp.

             d       Delta mode.  Count events relative to the previous sam-
                     ple.  Calculate CPU usage since the previous sample.
                     This mode by default disables the memory object map
                     reporting.  The memory object map reporting may be re-
                     enabled with the --rr option or the interactive rr command.

             e       Absolute mode.  Count events using absolute counters.

             n       Non-event mode (default).  Calculate CPU usage since the
                     previous sample.

     --ll _s_a_m_p_l_e_s
             Use logging mode and display _s_a_m_p_l_e_s samples, even if standard
             output is a terminal.  0 is treated as infinity.  Rather than
             redisplaying, output is periodically printed in raw form.  Note
             that the first sample displayed will have an invalid %CPU dis-
             played for each process, as it is calculated using the delta
             between samples.

     --nnccoollss _c_o_l_u_m_n_s
             Display _c_o_l_u_m_n_s when using logging mode.  The default is infi-
             nite.  The number must be >0 or an error will occur.

     --nn _n_p_r_o_c_s
             Only display up to _n_p_r_o_c_s processes.

     --OO _s_k_e_y
             Use _s_k_e_y as a secondary key when ordering the process display.
             See --oo for key names (pid is the default).

     --oo _k_e_y  Order the process display by sorting on _k_e_y in descending order.
             A + or - can be prefixed to the key name to specify ascending or
             descending order, respectively.  The supported keys are:

DDIISSPPLLAAYY
     The first several lines of the ttoopp display show various global state.
     All of the information is labeled.  Following is an alphabetical list of
     global state fields and their descriptions.

     CPU         Percentage of processor usage, broken into user, system, and
                 idle components.  The time period for which these percentages
                 are calculated depends on the event counting mode.

     Disks       Number and total size of disk reads and writes.

     LoadAvg     Load average over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.  The load average is
                 the average number of jobs in the run queue.

     MemRegions  Number and total size of memory regions, and total size of
                 memory regions broken into private (broken into non-library
                 and library) and shared components.

     Networks    Number and total size of input and output network packets.

     PhysMem     Physical memory usage, broken into wired, active, inactive,
                 used, and free components.

     Procs       Total number of processes and number of processes in each
                 process state.

     SharedLibs  Resident sizes of code and data segments, and link editor
                 memory usage.

     Threads     Number of threads.

     Time        Time, in H:MM:SS format.  When running in logging mode, Time
                 is in YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS format by default, but may be over-
                 ridden with accumulative mode.  When running in accumulative
                 event counting mode, the Time is in HH:MM:SS since the begin-
                 ning of the ttoopp process.

     VirtMem     Total virtual memory, virtual memory consumed by shared
                 libraries, and number of pageins and pageouts.

     Swap        Swap usage: total size of swap areas, amount of swap space in
                 use and amount of swap space available.

     Purgeable   Number of pages purged and number of pages currently purge-
                 able.

     Below the global state fields, a list of processes is displayed.  The
     fields that are displayed depend on the options that are set.  The pid
     field displays the following for the architecture:

     + for 64-bit native architecture, or - for 32-bit native architecture, or
     * for a non-native architecture.

IINNTTEERRAACCTTIIOONN
     When ttoopp is run in interactive (non-logging) mode, it is possible to con-
     trol the output of ttoopp, as well as interactively send signals to pro-
     cesses.  The interactive command syntax is terse.  Each command is one
     character, followed by 0 to 2 arguments.  Commands that take arguments
     prompt interactively for the arguments, and where applicable, the default
     value is shown in square brackets.  The default value can be selected by
     leaving the input field blank and pressing enter.  ^G escapes the inter-
     active argument prompt, and has the same effect as leaving the input
     field blank and pressing enter.

     The following commands are supported:

     ?       Display the help screen.  Any character exits help screen mode.
             This command always works, even in the middle of a command.

     ^L      Redraw the screen.

     c_m_o_d_e   Set output mode to _m_o_d_e.  See the --cc option for descriptions of
             the allowed modes.

     O_s_k_e_y   Use _s_k_e_y as a secondary key when ordering the process display.
             See the --oo option for key names.

     o_k_e_y    Order the process display by sorting on _k_e_y in descending order.
             A + or - can be prefixed to the key name to specify ascending or
             descending order, respectively.  The supported keys and alises
             are listed with the --oo option above.

     q       Quit.

     r       Toggle traversal and reporting of the memory object map for each
             process.

     S_s_i_g_n_a_l_p_i_d
             Send signal _s_i_g_n_a_l to _p_i_d.  _s_i_g_n_a_l can be specified either as a
             number or as a name (for example, HUP).  The default signal
             starts out as TERM.  Each time a signal is successfully sent, the
             default signal is updated to be that signal.  _p_i_d is a process
             id.

     s _d_e_l_a_y_-_s_e_c_s
             Set the delay between updates to _d_e_l_a_y_-_s_e_c_s seconds.

     U _u_s_e_r  Only display processes owned by _u_s_e_r_. Either the username or uid
             number can be specified.  To display all processes, press enter
             without entering a username or uid number.

     Calculating detailed memory statistics is fundamentally resource-inten-
     sive.  To reduce the CPU usage in ttoopp, the --ii option has been introduced
     to allow the user to tune this tradeoff.  With the default value of 10,
     framework stats will be updated once every 10 samples.  Specifying --ii _1
     will result in the most accurate display, at the expense of system
     resources.

     When N/A occurs in a stat, it's caused by the memory object map reporting
     being disabled.  Memory object map reporting is disabled by default in
     delta mode, but may be optionally enabled via --rr or the interactive rr
     command.  To enable the --rr option, use it after any --cc mode options.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     top -o cpu -O +rsize -s 5 -n 20
             Sort the processes according to CPU usage (descending) and resi-

             second intervals, and limit the display to 20 processes.

     top -c d
             Run ttoopp in delta mode.

     top -stats pid,command,cpu,th,pstate,time
             Display only the specified statistics, regardless of any growth
             of the terminal.  If the terminal is too small, only the statis-
             tics that fit will be displayed.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     aassrr efficiently copies disk images onto volumes, either directly or via a
     multicast network stream.  aassrr can also accurately clone volumes without
     the use of an intermediate disk image.

     In its first form, aassrr copies _s_o_u_r_c_e (usually a disk image, potentially
     on an HTTP server) to _t_a_r_g_e_t.  _s_o_u_r_c_e can be specified using a path in
     the filesystem, or an http or https URL.  It can also be an asr:// URL to
     indicate a multicast source.  aassrr can also be invoked with its second
     form to act as a multicast server.  In its third form, aassrr will restore a
     multicast disk image to a file instead of disk volume.  In its fourth
     form, aassrr prepares a disk image to be restored efficiently, adding whole-
     volume checksum information.  hheellpp and vveerrssiioonn provide usage and version
     information, respectively.

     _s_o_u_r_c_e and _t_a_r_g_e_t can be /dev entries or volume mountpoints. For more
     information on restoring to or from APFS filesystems, see the RREESSTTOORRIINNGG
     WWIITTHH AAPPFFSS FFIILLEESSYYSSTTEEMMSS section below.  If restoring a multicast disk image
     to a file, _f_i_l_e can be a path to a local file or directory. If the speci-
     fied path is a file, the disk image is given the specified name. If a
     directory, the name of the disk image being multicast is used. When spec-
     ifying sseerrvveerr,, _s_o_u_r_c_e has to be a UDIF disk image. Restoring from a mul-
     ticast stream is accomplished by passing a asr:// url as _s_o_u_r_c_e.

     When run in its first form above, the ----eerraassee option must always be used,
     as aassrr no longer supports file copying.  Such functionality is done bet-
     ter by ditto(1).

     aassrr needs to be run as root (see sudo(8)) in order to accomplish its
     tasks.

     Each verb is listed with its description and individual arguments.

     rreessttoorree       restores a disk image or volume to another volume (includ-
                   ing a mounted disk image)

                   ----ssoouurrccee       can be a disk image, /dev entry, or volume
                                  mountpoint. In the latter two cases, the
                                  volume must be unmountable or mounted read-
                                  only in order for a erase blockcopy to occur
                                  (thus, one cannot erase blockcopy the root
                                  filesystem as the source, unless it happened
                                  to be mounted read-only).

                   ----ttaarrggeett       can be a /dev entry, or volume mountpoint.
                                  Must be unmountable in order for an erase
                                  block-copy to occur.  If _s_o_u_r_c_e specifies an

                                  specify a mounted APFS volume.  See the

                                  below for details.

                   ----ffiillee         when performing a multicast restore, ----ffiillee
                                  can be specified instead of ----ttaarrggeett.. If the
                                  specified path is a file, the disk image is
                                  given the specified name. If a directory,
                                  the name of the disk image being multicast
                                  is used.

                   ----eerraassee        erases _t_a_r_g_e_t and is required.  ----eerraassee must
                                  always be used, as file copies are no longer
                                  supported by aassrr.  If _s_o_u_r_c_e is a asr:// url
                                  for restoring from a multicast stream,
                                  ----eerraassee must be passed (multicasting only
                                  supports erase block-copy restores).  Pass-
                                  ing ----eerraassee with ----ffiillee indicates any exist-
                                  ing file should be overwritten when doing a
                                  multicast file copy.

                   ----ffoorrmmaatt _H_F_S_+ | _H_F_S_X
                                  specifies the destination filesystem format,
                                  when ----eerraassee is also given. If not speci-
                                  fied, the destination will be formatted with
                                  the same filesystem format as the source. If
                                  multicasting, the ----ffoorrmmaatt specified must be
                                  block copy compatible with the _s_o_u_r_c_e.
                                  ----ffoorrmmaatt is ignored if ----eerraassee is not used.
                                  Note: HFS Journaling is an attribute of the
                                  source image, and is not affected by
                                  ----ffoorrmmaatt.

                   ----nnoopprroommpptt     suppresses the prompt which usually occurs
                                  before _t_a_r_g_e_t is erased.  newfs_hfs(8) will
                                  be called on _t_a_r_g_e_t and once you start writ-
                                  ing new data, there isn't much hope for
                                  recovery.  You have been warned.

                   ----ttiimmeeoouutt _n_u_m  specifies _n_u_m seconds that a multicast
                                  client should wait when no payload data has
                                  been received over a multicast stream before
                                  exiting, allowing the client to stop in case
                                  of server failure/stoppage.  It defaults to
                                  0 (i.e. never time out).

                   ----ppuuppppeettssttrriinnggss
                                  provide progress output that is easy for
                                  another program to parse.  Any program try-
                                  ing to interpret aassrr's progress should use
                                  ----ppuuppppeettssttrriinnggss.

                   ----nnoovveerriiffyy     skips the verification steps normally taken
                                  to ensure that a volume has been properly
                                  restored.  ----nnoovveerriiffyy allows images which
                                  have not been scanned to be restored.  Skip-
                                  ping verification is dangerous for a number
                                  of reasons and should never be used in pro-
                                  duction systems.

                   ----aalllloowwffrraaggmmeenntteeddccaattaalloogg
                                  allows restores to proceed even if the
                                  source's catalog file is fragmented (in par-
                                  ticular, if it has more than 8 extents).  By
                                  default such restores are disallowed.  Cata-
                                  log fragmentation is undesirable and in most
                                  cases it is better to fix the problem on the
                                  source (e.g. by running fsck_hfs -r on it),
                                  but ----aalllloowwffrraaggmmeenntteeddccaattaalloogg is provided for
                                  situations where such a change is impracti-
                                  cal.  This option only makes sense if the
                                  source specifes an HFS+ filesystem variant.
                                  It is otherwise ignored.

                   ----ccoorreessttoorraaggeeccoonnvveerrtt
                                  Cause _t_a_r_g_e_t to be converted to a Core Stor-
                                  age LVG at the end of the restore.  After
                                  the copy and verify are complete, aassrr will
                                  create a new Core Storage Logical Volume
                                  Group (LVG), using the partition represented
                                  by _t_a_r_g_e_t as its only physical volume (PV).
                                  The volume contents restored from _s_o_u_r_c_e
                                  will be present as a single logical volume
                                  (LV) exported from this LVG.  If _t_a_r_g_e_t is
                                  already a Core Storage LV, then this option
                                  has no effect.

                   ----SSHHAA225566       forces the restore to use the SHA-256 hash
                                  in the image during verification.  If the
                                  image doesn't contain a SHA-256 hash, then
                                  an error will be raised.

                   ----ssoouurrcceevvoolluummeennaammee
                                  tells aassrr which volume in the _s_o_u_r_c_e con-

                                  It is an error if more than one volume has
                                  the specified name.  You can see the volume
                                  names and UUIDs by running aassrr with the iinnffoo
                                  verb.  See the section RREESSTTOORRIINNGG WWIITTHH AAPPFFSS

                                  tells aassrr which volume in the _s_o_u_r_c_e con-

                                  You can see the volume names and UUIDs by
                                  running aassrr with the iinnffoo verb.  See the

     rreessttoorreeeexxaacctt  performs the same operation as rreessttoorree, taking all the same
                   options, but with the following difference:  the target
                   partition is resized to exactly match the size of the
                   source partition/volume, if such a resize can be done.  If
                   the target partition needs to grow and there is not enough
                   space, then the operation will fail.  If it needs to
                   shrink, then it should always be able to do so, possibly
                   leaving free space in the target disk's partition map.
                   Because the target exactly matches the source in size, all
                   volume structures should be identical in source and target
                   upon completion of the restore.

                   ----ssoouurrccee   _s_o_u_r_c_e has to be a UDIF disk image. A path to a
                              disk image on a local/remote volume can be
                              passed in, or a http:// url to a disk image that
                              is accessible via a web server.

                   ----ccoonnffiigg   sseerrvveerr requires a configuration file to be
                              passed, in standard property list format.  The
                              following keys/options configure the various
                              parameters for multicast operation.

                   Data Rate              this is the desired data rate in
                                          bytes per second.  On average, the
                                          stream will go slightly slower than
                                          this speed, but will never exceed
                                          it.  It's a number in the plist
                                          (-int when set with defaults(1)).

                                          Note: The performance/reliability of

                                          multicast on is an important factor
                                          in determining what data rate can be
                                          supported. Excessive/bursty packet
                                          loss for a given data rate could be
                                          due to an inability of the
                                          server/client to be able to
                                          send/receive multicast data at that
                                          rate, but it's equally important to
                                          verify that the network infrastruc-
                                          ture can support multicasting at the
                                          requested rate.

     Individual APFS volumes can not be restored directly, because their
     device nodes don't allow I/O from a standard process.  However, aassrr can
     restore entire APFS containers, including all volumes.  Or it can restore
     valid system configurations, which can get the effect of restoring a sin-
     gle system.  This requires understanding what is meant by a vvaalliidd ssyysstteemm..

     In order for an APFS volume to be bootable, it must contain a properly
     installed macOS system.  It must also be part of an APFS container which
     also has two special volumes in it: a Preboot volume and a Recovery vol-
     ume.  A container may have arbitrarily many system volumes in it, but it
     must have only one Preboot volume and one Recovery volume, each with the
     corresponding APFS volume role set (see diskutil(1) for information on
     roles).  The Preboot and Recovery volumes contain information which is
     tied to each system volume in the container.  So for a system volume to
     be bootable, that information needs to be set up in the Preboot and
     Recovery volumes.  A system which is part of a container that has these
     two special volumes, and for which the requisite information is set up in
     those volumes, will be referred to here as a vvaalliidd ssyysstteemm..

     If the _s_o_u_r_c_e of a restore is an APFS image (i.e. an image which contains
     an APFS container), then aassrr does different things depending on how
     _t_a_r_g_e_t was specified:

     Volume Restore
           If the _t_a_r_g_e_t is an individual volume within an existing APFS con-
           tainer, then aassrr will block restore the APFS container to a file
           within that volume, after which it will invert the volume within
           the restored container, erasing the previous contents of the _t_a_r_g_e_t
           volume and replacing them with the source volume contents.  If the
           _s_o_u_r_c_e container only has a single non-special volume (i.e. not
           Preboot or Recovery), then that is the volume which will be
           inverted.  If the _s_o_u_r_c_e container has more than one non-special
           volume, then either the ----ssoouurrcceevvoolluummeennaammee or ----ssoouurrcceevvoolluummeeUUUUIIDD
           option must be present and must specify the volume to invert.
           Additionally, if the volume being inverted is a vvaalliidd ssyysstteemm (as
           defined above), then the relevant contents of both the Preboot and
           Recovery volumes will be copied from the _s_o_u_r_c_e to the _t_a_r_g_e_t, cre-
           ating those volumes on the _t_a_r_g_e_t if necessary.

     Volume Restore with Creation
           If the _t_a_r_g_e_t is a synthesized APFS whole disk or Apple_APFS parti-
           tion, and the ----eerraassee option is not present, then aassrr will create a
           new volume in the given container, after which it will do a volume
           restore to that new volume, as with the previous section.  All
           other volumes in the container are preserved.

     Volume Restore with Erase
           If the _t_a_r_g_e_t is a synthesized APFS whole disk or any disk parti-
           tion, and the ----eerraassee option is present, then aassrr will erase the
           existing partition, create a new APFS container and a new volume in
           it, after which it will do a volume restore to that new volume, as
           with the previous section.

     See the EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS section below for some command lines that show these
     operations.

BBUUFFFFEERRIINNGG
     The following options control how aassrr uses memory.  These options can
     have a significant impact on performance.  aassrr is optimized for copying
     between devices (different disk drives, from a network volume to a local
     disk, etc).  As such, aassrr defaults to using eight one megabyte buffers.
     These buffers are wired down (occupying physical memory).  For partition
     to partition copies on the same device, one large buffer (e.g. 32 MB) is
     much faster than the default eight medium sized ones. For multicast, 4
     256k buffers are the default.  Custom buffering for multicast operation
     is not recommended.

     ----ccssuummbbuuffffeerrss and ----ccssuummbbuuffffeerrssiizzee allow a different buffer configuration
     for checksumming operations.  One checksum buffer offers the best perfor-
     mance.  The default is 1 1MB buffer. Custom checksum buffering is not
     recommended.

     Like mkfile(8), _s_i_z_e defaults to bytes but can be followed by a multi-
     plier character (e.g. 'm').

     ----bbuuffffeerrss _n_u_m
                 specifies that _n_u_m buffers should be used.

     ----bbuuffffeerrssiizzee _s_i_z_e
                 specifies the size of each buffer.

     ----ccssuummbbuuffffeerrss _n_u_m
                 specifies that _n_u_m buffers should be used for checksumming
                 operations (which only affect the target).  Custom checksum
                 buffering is not recommended.

     ----ccssuummbbuuffffeerrssiizzee _s_i_z_e
                 specifies the size of each buffer used for checksumming.
                 Custom checksum buffering is not recommended.

     Will receive the multicast stream from <hostname> and save it to a file.

     used the save the file. --erase causes any existing file with the same

           sudo asr restore -s <APFS image> -t /Volumes/MyAPFSVolume --erase
     In this case the contents of MyAPFSVolume will be replaced by the con-
     tents of the source container's single APFS volume, possibly including
     any associated data for the Preboot and Recovery volumes, if the source
     is a vvaalliidd ssyysstteemm.  If the source has more than one non-special volume,
     this is an error.  No other volumes in the target will be affected.

           sudo asr restore -s <APFS image> --sourcevolumename SourceVolume -t
           /Volumes/MyAPFSVolume --erase
     This tells aassrr to select the volume named ""SourceVolume"" from the given
     APFS image.  If there is no volume with that name, or if there are more
     than one with that name, it is an error.  Use the iinnffoo verb to see the
     volume names and UUIDs for an image.  No other volumes in the target will
     be affected.

           sudo asr restore -s <APFS image> --sourcevolumename SourceVolume -t
           /dev/disk2
     Here we get the same effect as the last example, except that aassrr will
     create a new volume on the target APFS container disk, given by
     /dev/disk2, and use that newly created volume as the target.  Any volumes
     which already existed in the container will still be there after the
     restore.

           sudo asr restore -s <APFS image> --sourcevolumename SourceVolume -t
           /dev/disk2 --erase
     Like the last example, we restore to a new volume on the target APFS con-
     tainer disk.  However in this case we are erasing the target, so any vol-
     umes which already existed are destroyed.

     Assuming this image has been previously scanned (using the iimmaaggeessccaann

     aassrr requires a properly created disk image for most efficient operation.
     This image is most easily made with the Disk Utility application's ""Image
     from Folder"" function in OS X 10.3.  The Disk Copy from OS X 10.2.3
     (v55.6) or later can also be used.

     Basic steps for imaging and restoring a volume:

     1.   Set up the source volume the way you want it.

     2.   Use Disk Utility's ""File -> New Image -> Image from Folder..."" func-
          tion and select the root of the volume.  Save the image as read-only
          or compressed.  ""File->New Image->Image from <device>"" is not recom-
          mended for restorable images.

     3.   Scan the image with ""Images -> Scan Image for Restore...""

     4.   Select a volume and click on the ""Restore"" button.  Then click on
          the ""Image...""  button to select the image you have scanned.  Click
          Restore.

     aassrr can block copy restore HFS+/HFSX filesystems and resize the source
     filesystem to fit in the target's partition if the source filesystem data
     blocks will fit within the target partition's space (resizing the
     filesystem geometry as appropriate).

     HFS+ can be used as the source of a block copy to either an HFS+ or HFSX
     destination.  However, an HFSX source can only be used to block copy to
     an HFSX destination.  This is because case collision of file names could
     occur when converting from an HFSX filesystem to HFS+.

     Certain non-HFS+/HFSX filesystems will block copy restore, but the target
     partition will be resized to match the size of the source image/partition
     size, with no filesystem resizing occurring.

EERRRROORRSS
     aassrr will exit with status 1 if it cannot complete the requested opera-
     tion.  A human readable error message will be printed in most cases.  If
     aassrr has already started writing to the target volume when the error
     occurs, then it will erase the target, leaving it in a valid (but empty)
     state.  It will, however, leave it unmounted.

     Some of the error messages which aassrr prints are generated by the underly-
     ing subsystems that it uses, and their meaning is not always obvious.
     Here are some useful guidelines:

     1.   aassrr does some preflight testing before it starts actually copying
          data.  Errors that show up during this preflighting are usually
          clear (e.g. ""There is not enough space in volume ""Macintosh HD"" to
          do the restore."")

     2.   If an error occurs during the copy, it might be because there is
          corruption in the source image file.  Try running ""hdiutil verify""
          with the image.  A common error message which indicates this is
          ""codec overrun"".

     3.   Errors which occur during the copy and which don't have an obvious
          cause (i.e. the error message is difficult to interpret) may be
          transient in nature (e.g. there was an I/O error on the disk), and
          it is worth simply trying the restore again.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     Apple Software Restore got its start as a field service restoration tool
     used to reconfigure computers' software to 'factory' state.  It later
     became a more general software restore mechanism and software installa-
     tion helper application for various Apple computer products.  ASR has
     been used in manufacturing processes and in shipping computers' System
     Software Installers.

     For Mac OS X, asr was rewritten as a command line tool for manufacturing
     and professional customers.  aassrr is the backend for the Mac OS X Software
     Restore application that shipped on Macintosh computers as well as the
     Scan and Restore functionality in Disk Utility.

     Multicast support was added to allow multiple clients to erase restore an
     image from a multicast network stream.

     Per its history, most functionality in aassrr is limited to HFS+ volumes.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     ffddeesseettuupp is used to enable or disable FileVault, to list, add, or remove
     enabled FileVault users, and to obtain status about the current state of
     FileVault. Most commands require root access and need to be authenticated
     with either a FileVault password, a personal recovery key (if enabled),
     and in some cases the private key from the installed institutional recov-
     ery key.  Some status related commands can be run from a non-root ses-
     sion.

     Certain commands on CoreStorage volumes allow you to authenticate and
     unlock by providing the --kkeeyy option followed by the path to a keychain
     file containing the private key of the installed institutional recovery
     key.  Do not include the certificate in this keychain.

     By default, when enabling FileVault ffddeesseettuupp will only return a personal
     recovery key. Given the proper certificate information, ffddeesseettuupp can
     install an institutional recovery key.  You can also set it up without
     creating a personal recovery key using the --nnoorreeccoovveerryykkeeyy option, though
     this is not recommended unless you are also installing an institutional
     recovery key.  On APFS volumes, if you already have a personal recovery
     key created from a previous enablement, it will not remove or create a
     new personal recovery key, allowing you to reuse the existing key.
     Either type of keys can be added or changed at a later time.

     With the --kkeeyycchhaaiinn option, an institutional recovery key can be set up by
     placing an X.509 asymmetric public certificate in the /Library/Key-
     chains/FileVaultMaster.keychain file. sseeccuurriittyy ccrreeaattee--ffiilleevvaauullttmmaasstteerr--
     kkeeyycchhaaiinn can be used to create the keychain. Alternatively a certificate
     can be passed in by using the --cceerrttiiffiiccaattee option and entering the path
     to the DER encoded certificate file. In this case the FileVaultMas-
     ter.keychain file will be created using the certificate. With your .cer
     file, the optional certificate data can be obtained using the base64
     tool.  For example: 'base64 /path/to/mycert.cer > /mynewdata.txt', at
     which point you would copy the data string contained in the text file and
     place it into the Certificate <data></data> value area of the property
     list.  The certificate should be self signed, and the common name must be
     ""FileVault Recovery Key""

     Because the user password may not be immediately available, read the
     DEFERRED ENABLEMENT section below for information on how to delay
     enabling FileVault until the user logs in or out.

     The ssttaattuuss command will indicate if FileVault is On or Off.  If a File-
     Vault master keychain is installed into the /Library/Keychains folder it
     will also report this back.  Note that this, by itself, does not indicate
     whether or not FileVault has been set up with an institutional recovery
     key.  The --eexxtteennddeedd option will display extended status information,
     including the time remaining for encrypting or decrypting.  The calcula-
     tion of this remaining time may take a few minutes and is only an approx-
     imate value.

     The lliisstt command will display the short names and UUIDs of enabled File-
     Vault users. You can use the --eexxtteennddeedd option to display a full list of
     existing user types along with some additional information.  This infor-
     mation will include if the recovery key was escrowed, though note that it
     will show ""Yes"" even if the information has not yet been successfully
     sent to the server.  You can also use the --oofffflliinnee option to get a list
     of currently locked and offline CoreStorage FileVault volumes.  You can
     use this information as part of the hhaassppeerrssoonnaallrreeccoovveerryykkeeyy or
     hhaassiinnssttiittuuttiioonnaallrreeccoovveerryykkeeyy commands.

     The rreemmoovvee command will remove a user from FileVault given either the
     user name or the FileVault UUID.

     The ssyynncc command synchronizes Open Directory attributes (e.g. user pic-
     tures) with appropriate FileVault users, and removes FileVault users that
     were removed from Open Directory.   In most cases these changes will
     already be updated in FileVault.  ssyynncc does not add users to FileVault.

     Use the hhaassppeerrssoonnaallrreeccoovveerryykkeeyy or hhaassiinnssttiittuuttiioonnaallrreeccoovveerryykkeeyy commands to
     see if FileVault has a personal or institutional recovery key set up.  If
     FileVault is active and the key is set, by default these commands will
     return ""true"" or ""false"".  Note that ""false"" may also be returned if any
     error occurs, or if FileVault is not yet fully enabled.   You can use the
     ddeevviiccee option to specify either a mount path (e.g. /Volumes/myvolume), a
     bsd name identifier (e.g. disk0), or Logical Volume or Logical Volume
     Family UUID (obtained using either the lliisstt command, or using disku-
     til(8)).   If you specify a device parameter and it finds the institu-
     tional recovery key, a hex representation of the public key hash will be
     returned in lieu of ""true"".

     On CoreStorage volumes, if a user currently has the system unlocked using
     the recovery key, the uussiinnggrreeccoovveerryykkeeyy command will return ""true"".

     The cchhaannggeerreeccoovveerryy command changes or adds either the personal or insti-
     tutional recovery key.  You can only have one recovery key of each type,
     so any associated existing key will be removed.  The rreemmoovveerreeccoovveerryy com-
     mand will remove any existing recovery key of the type specified.  It is
     not recommended that you remove all recovery keys since, if you lose your
     FileVault password, you may not be able to access your information.   On
     APFS volumes using 10.14 or later, the existing recovery key can be used
     as authentication to change or remove the personal recovery key.

     On supported hardware, ffddeesseettuupp allows restart of a FileVault-enabled
     system without requiring unlock during the subsequent boot using the
     aauutthhrreessttaarrtt command. WARNING: FileVault protections are reduced during
     authenticated restarts. In particular, ffddeesseettuupp deliberately stores at
     least one additional copy of a permanent FDE (full disk encryption)
     unlock key in both system memory and (on supported systems) the System
     Management Controller (SMC).  ffddeesseettuupp must be run as root and itself
     prompts for a password to unlock the FileVault root volume.  Use ppmmsseett
     ddeessttrrooyyffvvkkeeyyoonnssttaannddbbyy to prevent saving the key across standby modes.
     Once aauutthhrreessttaarrtt is authenticated, it launches shutdown(8) and, upon suc-
     cessful unlock, the unlock key will be removed.  You can also use this as
     an option to the eennaabbllee command if the system supports this feature.  The
     ssuuppppoorrttssaauutthhrreessttaarrtt command will check the system to see if it supports
     the aauutthhrreessttaarrtt command option, however you should note that even if this
     returns true, FileVault must still be enabled for aauutthhrreessttaarrtt to work.

                Removes the current recovery key.   Either personal and/or
                institutional options must be specified.  The -key option can
                be optionally used to unlock FileVault.  More information on
                this is described elsewhere in this document.

                If FileVault is enabled on the current volume, it restarts the
                system, bypassing the initial unlock.   The optional
                -delayminutes option can be used to delay the restart command
                for a set number of minutes.  A value of 0 represents 'immedi-
                ately', and a value of -1 represents 'never'.  The command may
                not work on all systems.

                By default, this will return the string ""true"" if FileVault
                contains an institutional recovery key.   On CoreStorage vol-
                umes specified using the --device option, this will return the
                hex representation of the public key hash instead of ""true"".
                The hash option is not supported for APFS volumes.   This will
                return ""false"" if there is no institutional recovery key
                installed.

                this does not necessarily mean that authrestart will work
                since it requires that FileVault be enabled.

             Outputs the recovery key and additional system information to
             stdout in a plist dictionary.  If the recovery key changes, the
             dictionary will also contain a Change key and the EnableDate key
             will contain the date of the change.   Where possible, you should
             avoid writing this file to a persistent location since it may
             pose additional security risk, and at the very least, securely
             remove the file as soon as possible.

             option if your certificate data is located in the input plist
             information.   The common name of the certificate must be ""File-

             unlock and authenticate FileVault.

             Do not return a personal recovery key.   On APFS volumes, you can
             use this option to reuse an existing recovery key previously cre-
             ated.

             When using the -defer option, prompt the designated user at login
             time to enable FileVault.  The user has at most
             mmaaxx__ccaanncceell__aatttteemmppttss to cancel and bypass enabling FileVault
             before it will be required to log in.   If this value is 0, the
             user's next login will require that they enable FileVault before
             being allowed to use their account.   Other special values
             include -1 to ignore this option, and 9999, which means that the
             user should never be forced to enable FileVault (instead the user
             will just be prompted each time at login until FileVault is
             enabled).

     --ddoonnttaasskkaattllooggoouutt
             When using the -defer option, the default action will be to
             prompt the designated user at user logout time for their password
             in order to enable FileVault.  If this option is used, the logout
             enablement window is not shown.  The assumption is that you are
             instead using the -forceatlogin option to prompt at user login
             time to enable FileVault.

     --eexxtteennddeedd
             Return extended output information for certain commands.   When
             using this while checking status on enabling or disabling File-
             Vault on APFS volumes, a rough estimate of the time remaining
             will be displayed.  This value may take a few minutes to ini-
             tially calculate.   Hit Ctrl-C to stop the status display.

     --oofffflliinnee
             Display the current offline and locked FileVault volumes. Cur-

             Device location to be applied for the command.  This can be in
             the form ""disk1"", ""/Volumes/MyVolume"", or when asking for a
             CoreStorage recovery user, a UUID for the Logical Volume or Logi-
             cal Volume Family of a volume.   Not all commands can use this
             option.

             The integer number of minutes to delay the authenticated restart.
             If this option is not set or the value is 0, the auth restart
             will happen immediately.   A value of -1 will never attempt to
             automatically restart; instead the auth restart operation will
             occur whenever the user next restarts.

DDEEFFEERRRREEDD EENNAABBLLEEMMEENNTT
     The --ddeeffeerr option can be used with the eennaabbllee command option to delay
     enabling FileVault until after the current (or next) local user logs in
     or out, thus avoiding the need to enter a password when the tool is run.
     Depending on the options set, the user will either be prompted at logout
     time for the password, or the user will be prompted to enable FileVault
     when they log in. If the volume is not already a CoreStorage volume, the
     system may need to be restarted to start the encryption process. Dialogs
     are automatically dismissed and canceled after 60 seconds if no interac-
     tion occurs.

     The --ddeeffeerr option sets up a single user to be added to FileVault. If
     there was no user specified (e.g. without the --uusseerr option), then the
     currently logged in user will be added to the configuration and becomes
     the designated user. If there is no user specified and no users are
     logged in at the time of configuration, then the next user that logs in
     will become the designated user.

     As recovery key information is not generated until the user password is
     obtained, the --ddeeffeerr option requires a path where this information will
     be written to. The property list file will be created as a root-only
     readable file and should be placed in a secure location.  You can use the
     sshhoowwddeeffeerrrraalliinnffoo command to view the current deferral configuration
     information.

     Options that can be used in conjunction with the --ddeeffeerr option include:
     --kkeeyycchhaaiinn,, --cceerrttiiffiiccaattee,, --ffoorrcceerreessttaarrtt,, --ffoorrcceeaattllooggiinn,, --ddoonnttaasskkaattllooggoouutt,,
     --uusseerr,, and --nnoorreeccoovveerryykkeeyy..

     Note that if the designated user is being prompted at logout to enable
     FileVault, and doesn't complete the setup, FileVault will not be enabled,
     but the configuration will remain and be used again for the designated
     user's next logout (or login if the -forceatlogin option is enabled),
     thereby 'nagging' the user to enable FileVault.   When using the
     -forceatlogin option, the user is given a certain number of attempts to
     enable FileVault, in which they can cancel the operation and continue to
     use their system without FileVault.  When the number of cancel attempts
     is reached, the user will not be able to log into their account until
     FileVault is enabled.    The current value of the user's remaining
     attempts can be viewed using the sshhoowwddeeffeerrrraalliinnffoo command.   Special val-
     ues for the -forceatlogin option include setting it to '0' to force the
     enablement immediately at next login, a '-1' disables the check entirely,
     and a special value of '9999' means that the user will never be required
     to enable FileVault, though it will continually prompt the user until
     FileVault is enabled.   If a personal recovery key is used, the user
     should probably be warned ahead of time that, upon successful enablement,
     they will need to write down and keep in a safe place the FileVault
     recovery key shown on the screen.

     The designated user must be a local user (or a mobile account user).

     To remove an active deferred enablement configuration, you can use the
     ddiissaabbllee command, even if FileVault is not currently enabled.

     The ccaall utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format and nnccaall
     offers an alternative layout, more options and the date of Easter.  The
     new format is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25x80 termi-
     nal.  If arguments are not specified, the current month is displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     --hh      Turns off highlighting of today.

     --JJ      Display Julian Calendar, if combined with the --ee option, display
             date of Easter according to the Julian Calendar.

     --ee      Display date of Easter (for western churches).

     --jj      Display Julian days (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

     --mm _m_o_n_t_h
             Display the specified _m_o_n_t_h.  If _m_o_n_t_h is specified as a decimal
             number, it may be followed by the letter `f' or `p' to indicate
             the following or preceding month of that number, respectively.

     --oo      Display date of Orthodox Easter (Greek and Russian Orthodox
             Churches).

     --pp      Print the country codes and switching days from Julian to Grego-
             rian Calendar as they are assumed by nnccaall.  The country code as
             determined from the local environment is marked with an asterisk.

     --ss _c_o_u_n_t_r_y___c_o_d_e
             Assume the switch from Julian to Gregorian Calendar at the date
             associated with the _c_o_u_n_t_r_y___c_o_d_e.  If not specified, nnccaall tries
             to guess the switch date from the local environment or falls back
             to September 2, 1752.  This was when Great Britain and her
             colonies switched to the Gregorian Calendar.

     --ww      Print the number of the week below each week column.

     --yy      Display a calendar for the specified year.

     --33      Display the previous, current and next month surrounding today.

     --AA _n_u_m_b_e_r
             Display the _n_u_m_b_e_r of months after the current month.

     --BB _n_u_m_b_e_r
             Display the _n_u_m_b_e_r of months before the current month.

     --CC      Switch to ccaall mode.

     --NN      Switch to nnccaall mode.

     --dd _y_y_y_y_-_m_m
             Use _y_y_y_y_-_m_m as the current date (for debugging of date selec-
             tion).

     --HH _y_y_y_y_-_m_m_-_d_d
             Use _y_y_y_y_-_m_m_-_d_d as the current date (for debugging of highlight-
             ing).

     A single parameter specifies the year (1-9999) to be displayed; note the
     year must be fully specified: ``cal 89'' will _n_o_t display a calendar for
     1989.  Two parameters denote the month and year; the month is either a
     number between 1 and 12, or a full or abbreviated name as specified by
     the current locale.  Month and year default to those of the current sys-
     tem clock and time zone (so ``cal -m 8'' will display a calendar for the
     month of August in the current year).

     Not all options can be used together. For example ``-3 -A 2 -B 3 -y -m
     7'' would mean: show me the three months around the seventh month, three
     before that, two after that and the whole year.  nnccaall will warn about
     these combinations.

     A year starts on January 1.

     Highlighting of dates is disabled if stdout is not a tty.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The sseedd utility reads the specified files, or the standard input if no
     files are specified, modifying the input as specified by a list of com-
     mands.  The input is then written to the standard output.

     A single command may be specified as the first argument to sseedd.  Multiple
     commands may be specified by using the --ee or --ff options.  All commands
     are applied to the input in the order they are specified regardless of
     their origin.

     The following options are available:

     --EE      Interpret regular expressions as extended (modern) regular
             expressions rather than basic regular expressions (BRE's).  The
             re_format(7) manual page fully describes both formats.

     --aa      The files listed as parameters for the ``w'' functions are cre-
             ated (or truncated) before any processing begins, by default.
             The --aa option causes sseedd to delay opening each file until a com-
             mand containing the related ``w'' function is applied to a line
             of input.

     --ee _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
             Append the editing commands specified by the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d argument to
             the list of commands.

     --ff _c_o_m_m_a_n_d___f_i_l_e
             Append the editing commands found in the file _c_o_m_m_a_n_d___f_i_l_e to the
             list of commands.  The editing commands should each be listed on
             a separate line.

     --ii _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n
             Edit files in-place, saving backups with the specified _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n.
             If a zero-length _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n is given, no backup will be saved.  It
             is not recommended to give a zero-length _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n when in-place
             editing files, as you risk corruption or partial content in situ-
             ations where disk space is exhausted, etc.

     --ll      Make output line buffered.

     --nn      By default, each line of input is echoed to the standard output
             after all of the commands have been applied to it.  The --nn option
             suppresses this behavior.

     The form of a sseedd command is as follows:

           [address[,address]]function[arguments]

     Whitespace may be inserted before the first address and the function por-
     tions of the command.

     Normally, sseedd cyclically copies a line of input, not including its termi-
     nating newline character, into a _p_a_t_t_e_r_n _s_p_a_c_e, (unless there is some-
     thing left after a ``D'' function), applies all of the commands with
     addresses that select that pattern space, copies the pattern space to the
     standard output, appending a newline, and deletes the pattern space.

     Some of the functions use a _h_o_l_d _s_p_a_c_e to save all or part of the pattern
     space for subsequent retrieval.

SSeedd AAddddrreesssseess
     An address is not required, but if specified must be a number (that
     counts input lines cumulatively across input files), a dollar (``$'')
     character that addresses the last line of input, or a context address
     (which consists of a regular expression preceded and followed by a delim-
     iter).

     A command line with no addresses selects every pattern space.

     A command line with one address selects all of the pattern spaces that
     match the address.

     A command line with two addresses selects an inclusive range.  This range
     starts with the first pattern space that matches the first address.  The
     end of the range is the next following pattern space that matches the
     second address.  If the second address is a number less than or equal to
     the line number first selected, only that line is selected.  In the case
     when the second address is a context address, sseedd does not re-match the
     second address against the pattern space that matched the first address.
     Starting at the first line following the selected range, sseedd starts look-
     ing again for the first address.

     Editing commands can be applied to non-selected pattern spaces by use of
     the exclamation character (``!'') function.

SSeedd RReegguullaarr EExxpprreessssiioonnss
     The regular expressions used in sseedd, by default, are basic regular
     expressions (BREs, see re_format(7) for more information), but extended
     (modern) regular expressions can be used instead if the --EE flag is given.
     In addition, sseedd has the following two additions to regular expressions:

     1.   In a context address, any character other than a backslash (``\'')
          or newline character may be used to delimit the regular expression.
          Also, putting a backslash character before the delimiting character
          causes the character to be treated literally.  For example, in the
          context address \xabc\xdefx, the RE delimiter is an ``x'' and the
          second ``x'' stands for itself, so that the regular expression is
          ``abcxdef''.

     2.   The escape sequence \n matches a newline character embedded in the
          pattern space.  You cannot, however, use a literal newline character
          in an address or in the substitute command.

     One special feature of sseedd regular expressions is that they can default
     to the last regular expression used.  If a regular expression is empty,
     i.e., just the delimiter characters are specified, the last regular
     expression encountered is used instead.  The last regular expression is
     defined as the last regular expression used as part of an address or sub-
     stitute command, and at run-time, not compile-time.  For example, the
     command ``/abc/s//XXX/'' will substitute ``XXX'' for the pattern ``abc''.

SSeedd FFuunnccttiioonnss
     In the following list of commands, the maximum number of permissible
     addresses for each command is indicated by [0addr], [1addr], or [2addr],
     representing zero, one, or two addresses.

     The argument _t_e_x_t consists of one or more lines.  To embed a newline in
     the text, precede it with a backslash.  Other backslashes in text are
     deleted and the following character taken literally.

     The ``r'' and ``w'' functions take an optional file parameter, which
     should be separated from the function letter by white space.  Each file
     given as an argument to sseedd is created (or its contents truncated) before
     any input processing begins.

     The ``b'', ``r'', ``s'', ``t'', ``w'', ``y'', ``!'', and ``:'' functions
     all accept additional arguments.  The following synopses indicate which
     arguments have to be separated from the function letters by white space
     characters.

     Two of the functions take a function-list.  This is a list of sseedd func-
     tions separated by newlines, as follows:

           { function
             function
             ...
             function
           }

     The ``{'' can be preceded by white space and can be followed by white
     space.  The function can be preceded by white space.  The terminating
     ``}'' must be preceded by a newline or optional white space.

     [2addr] function-list
             Execute function-list only when the pattern space is selected.

     [1addr]a\
     text    Write _t_e_x_t to standard output immediately before each attempt to
             read a line of input, whether by executing the ``N'' function or
             by beginning a new cycle.

     [2addr]b[label]
             Branch to the ``:'' function with the specified label.  If the
             label is not specified, branch to the end of the script.

     [2addr]c\
     text    Delete the pattern space.  With 0 or 1 address or at the end of a
             2-address range, _t_e_x_t is written to the standard output.

     [2addr]d
             Delete the pattern space and start the next cycle.

     [2addr]D
             Delete the initial segment of the pattern space through the first
             newline character and start the next cycle.

     [2addr]g
             Replace the contents of the pattern space with the contents of
             the hold space.

     [2addr]G
             Append a newline character followed by the contents of the hold
             space to the pattern space.

     [2addr]h
             Replace the contents of the hold space with the contents of the
             pattern space.

     [2addr]H
             Append a newline character followed by the contents of the pat-
             tern space to the hold space.

     [1addr]i\
     text    Write _t_e_x_t to the standard output.

     [2addr]l
             (The letter ell.)  Write the pattern space to the standard output
             in a visually unambiguous form.  This form is as follows:

                   backslash          \\
                   alert              \a
                   form-feed          \f
                   carriage-return    \r
                   tab                \t
                   vertical tab       \v

             Nonprintable characters are written as three-digit octal numbers
             (with a preceding backslash) for each byte in the character (most
             significant byte first).  Long lines are folded, with the point
             of folding indicated by displaying a backslash followed by a new-
             line.  The end of each line is marked with a ``$''.

     [2addr]n
             Write the pattern space to the standard output if the default
             output has not been suppressed, and replace the pattern space
             with the next line of input.

     [2addr]N
             Append the next line of input to the pattern space, using an
             embedded newline character to separate the appended material from
             the original contents.  Note that the current line number
             changes.

     [2addr]p
             Write the pattern space to standard output.

     [2addr]P
             Write the pattern space, up to the first newline character to the
             standard output.

     [1addr]q
             Branch to the end of the script and quit without starting a new
             cycle.

     [1addr]r file
             Copy the contents of _f_i_l_e to the standard output immediately
             before the next attempt to read a line of input.  If _f_i_l_e cannot
             be read for any reason, it is silently ignored and no error con-
             dition is set.

     [2addr]s/regular expression/replacement/flags
             Substitute the replacement string for the first instance of the
             regular expression in the pattern space.  Any character other
             than backslash or newline can be used instead of a slash to
             delimit the RE and the replacement.  Within the RE and the
             replacement, the RE delimiter itself can be used as a literal
             character if it is preceded by a backslash.

             An ampersand (``&'') appearing in the replacement is replaced by
             the string matching the RE.  The special meaning of ``&'' in this
             context can be suppressed by preceding it by a backslash.  The
             string ``\#'', where ``#'' is a digit, is replaced by the text
             matched by the corresponding backreference expression (see
             re_format(7)).

             A line can be split by substituting a newline character into it.
             To specify a newline character in the replacement string, precede
             it with a backslash.

             The value of _f_l_a_g_s in the substitute function is zero or more of
             the following:

                   _N       Make the substitution only for the _N'th occurrence
                           of the regular expression in the pattern space.

                   g       Make the substitution for all non-overlapping
                           matches of the regular expression, not just the
                           first one.

                   p       Write the pattern space to standard output if a
                           replacement was made.  If the replacement string is
                           identical to that which it replaces, it is still
                           considered to have been a replacement.

                   w _f_i_l_e  Append the pattern space to _f_i_l_e if a replacement
                           was made.  If the replacement string is identical
                           to that which it replaces, it is still considered
                           to have been a replacement.

     [2addr]t [label]
             Branch to the ``:'' function bearing the label if any substitu-
             tions have been made since the most recent reading of an input
             line or execution of a ``t'' function.  If no label is specified,
             branch to the end of the script.

     [2addr]w _f_i_l_e
             Append the pattern space to the _f_i_l_e.

     [2addr]x
             Swap the contents of the pattern and hold spaces.

     [2addr]y/string1/string2/
             Replace all occurrences of characters in _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 in the pattern
             space with the corresponding characters from _s_t_r_i_n_g_2.  Any char-
             acter other than a backslash or newline can be used instead of a
             slash to delimit the strings.  Within _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 and _s_t_r_i_n_g_2, a
             backslash followed by an ``n'' is replaced by a newline charac-
             ter.  A pair of backslashes is replaced by a literal backslash.
             Finally, a backslash followed by any other character (except a
             newline) is that literal character.

     [2addr]!function
     [2addr]!function-list
             Apply the function or function-list only to the lines that are
             _n_o_t selected by the address(es).

     [0addr]:label
             This function does nothing; it bears a label to which the ``b''
             and ``t'' commands may branch.

     [1addr]=
             Write the line number to the standard output followed by a new-
             line character.

     [0addr]
             Empty lines are ignored.

     [0addr]#
             The ``#'' and the remainder of the line are ignored (treated as a
             comment), with the single exception that if the first two charac-
             ters in the file are ``#n'', the default output is suppressed.
             This is the same as specifying the --nn option on the command line.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     ddrruuttiill uses the DiscRecording framework to interact with attached burning
     devices.  Common verbs include bbuurrnn, eerraassee, eejjeecctt, hheellpp, iinnffoo, lliisstt,
     ssttaattuuss, and ttrraayy.

     The rest of the verbs are: bbuullkkeerraassee, ccddtteexxtt, ddiisscciinnffoo, dduummppiissoo, dduummppuuddff,

VVEERRBBSS
     Each verb is listed with its description and individual arguments.  Drive
     selection arguments must appear before individual arguments.  Drive
     selection and argument descriptions can be found after the verb descrip-
     tions in the Drive Selection Criteria section.

     --ddrriivvee _d_r_i_v_e_(_s_)
                Lets you specify a drive or drives, per the output of lliisstt,
                for those verbs that can operate on one or more drives.  See
                the Drive Selection Criterion section for more info.

     hheellpp _v_e_r_b
                Display the usage information for the specified verb.

     aattiipp
                Displays the Absolute Time in Pre-Groove (ATIP) for inserted
                CD-R/RW media.

     bbuullkkeerraassee _t_y_p_e
                Starts bulk erase mode, in which the drive will continually
                erase inserted -RW media, eject it, and prompt for another
                disc until terminated.

                Types of erase:
                qquuiicckk    Performs a quick erase, doing the minimal amount of
                         work to make the disc appear blank. This operation
                         typically takes only a minute or two.

                ffuullll     Performs a complete erase, erasing every block on the
                         disk. This operation is slow (on the order of 30 min-
                         utes) to complete.

     bbuurrnn _o_p_t_i_o_n_s _p_a_t_h
                Burns a valid directory or image file to disc. The default is
                to burn the specified directory to a new filesystem. The
                --aauuddiioo option creates an audio CD (redbook) in which any valid
                QuickTime audio file present in the path is converted to a
                track (in alphabetical order). If a file is specified (valid
                image files only: .dmg, .iso, .cue/bin, and .toc) the contents
                of the image file are burned. Pre-burn and post-burn options,
                and filesystem exclusions can be specificed for enhanced func-
                tionality. Last option takes precedence. Invalid commands are
                ignored.

                _p_a_t_h     A valid path to a directory or file.

                _o_p_t_i_o_n_s  Specify an arbitrary valid burn option(s): --tteesstt,
                         --aappppeennddaabbllee, --eerraassee, --mmoouunntt, --nnoovveerriiffyy, --nnoohhffsspplluuss,

                         --pprreeggaapp.  Or specify a default burn option: --nnootteesstt,
                         --nnooaappppeennddaabbllee, --nnooeerraassee, --aallllffss, --hhffsspplluuss, --iissoo99666600,
                         --jjoolliieett, --uuddff, --ddaattaa, --eejjeecctt, --vveerriiffyy.

     ccddtteexxtt
                Reads and displays any CD-Text information reported by the
                drive. The drive must contain an audio CD, and be capable of
                reading CD-Text.

     ddiisscciinnffoo [-xml]

     eejjeecctt
                Synonym for ddrruuttiill ttrraayy eejjeecctt.

     eerraassee _t_y_p_e
                Erases -RW media in the drive(s) and ejects it.

                Types of erase:
                qquuiicckk    Performs a quick erase, doing the minimal amount of
                         work to make the disc appear blank. This operation
                         typically takes only a minute or two.

                ffuullll     Performs a complete erase, erasing every block on the
                         disk. This operation is slow (on the order of 30 min-
                         utes) to complete.

     ffiilleennaammee _n_a_m_e
                Shows how the specified filename will be modified to comply
                with the naming rules of the filesystems that DiscRecording
                generates.

     ggeettccoonnffiigg _t_y_p_e
                Displays device feature and profile list.

                Types of config information:
                ccuurrrreenntt  Displays current features and profiles for a drive.

                ssuuppppoorrtteedd Displays all supported features and profiles for a
                         drive.

     iinnffoo [-xml]
                Displays various pieces of information for each drive, includ-
                ing how it's connected to the computer and a summary of capa-
                bilities.

     lliisstt [-xml]

     ssiizzee _o_p_t_i_o_n_s _p_a_t_h
                Estimates the size of a valid directory or image file (in
                blocks). The default is to estimate the size of the specified
                path as a hybrid filesystem. The --aauuddiioo option calculates the
                contents of the directory as an audio CD (redbook) (for appli-
                cable files). If a file is specified (valid image files only:
                .dmg, .iso, .cue/bin, and .toc) the contents of the image file
                will be calculated. Filesystem exclusions can be specificed
                for enhanced functionality. Calculated size will be compared
                against blank media that is found unless the --nnooddrriivvee argument
                is specified. Last option takes precedence. Invalid commands
                are ignored.

                _p_a_t_h     A valid path to a directory or file.

                _o_p_t_i_o_n_s  Specify an arbitrary valid burn option(s): --nnooddrriivvee,

                         --aauuddiioo, --pprreeggaapp.  Or specify a default burn option:
                         --aallllffss, --hhffsspplluuss, --iissoo99666600, --jjoolliieett, --uuddff, --ddaattaa.

     ssttaattuuss [-xml]
                Displays detailed media-specific information.

     ssuubbcchhaannnneell
                Displays information from the subchannels on CD media. This
                prints the MCN (media catalog number) for the disc, and the
                ISRC (international standard recording code) for all tracks.
                This command only works when CD media is present.

                From the MMC command of the same name.

     ttoocc
                Displays table of contents (TOC) of inserted media.

     ttrraacckkiinnffoo [-xml]
                Displays detailed information about all tracks present on the
                media.

                From the MMC command of the same name.

     ttrraayy _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
                Performs a tray/media related command. Note that some drives
                do not have trays, and some have trays but may lack motorized
                eject or inject capability.

                Tray commands:
                ooppeenn     Opens a drive's tray, if no media is present and the
                         drive has a tray capable of motorized eject.

                cclloossee    Closes a drive's tray, if the drive has a tray capa-
                         ble of motorized inject.

                eejjeecctt    Ejects media from the drive, if the drive has a tray
                         capable of motorized eject. If no media is present,
                         this is equivalent to ooppeenn.  If media is present and
                         can be unmounted, it will be unmounted and then
                         ejected.  If media is present but cannot be
                         unmounted, the eject will fail.

     vveerrssiioonn
                Displays operating system and DiscRecording framework version
                numbers.

     --xxmmll
                When specified (valid options only: ddiisscciinnffoo, iinnffoo, lliisstt,
                ssttaattuuss, aanndd ttrraacckkiinnffoo) the output for the specified verb will

DDRRIIVVEE SSEELLEECCTTIIOONN CCRRIITTEERRIIAA
     Some functions of ddrruuttiill operate on a specific drive. Since any number of
     drives may be available, and they may come and go at any time, the device
     selection arguments provide a method for selecting among them.

     The candidate list starts out as a list of all attached drives. One or
     more arguments of the form --ddrriivvee _d_r_i_v_e_(_s_) may be specified. Each argu-
     ment has the effect of narrowing the candidate list, depending on what
     _d_r_i_v_e_(_s_) is. It may be:

         ++oo        A positive decimal number, assumed to be a 1-based index
                  into the candidate list. The candidate list is trimmed to
                  just that device.

         ++oo        One of the following keywords: iinntteerrnnaall, eexxtteerrnnaall, uussbb,
                  ffiirreewwiirree, aattaappii, ssccssii.  The candidate list is trimmed to
                  devices which match the specified location / bus. Case is
                  ignored in this comparison.

         ++oo        Any other string, assumed to be a vendor/product name. The
                  candidate list is trimmed to devices whose vendor or product
                  strings exactly match the argument. Case (but not white-
                  space) is ignored in this comparison.

     Multiple --ddrriivvee arguments may be specified; each argument narrows the
     candidate list further. After all the --ddrriivvee arguments have been pro-
     cessed, the candidate list is considered. If it contains exactly one
     item, that drive is used. If it contains zero items, ddrruuttiill prints an
     error message and exits. If it contains more than one item, the selected
     function is executed on all drives remaining in the list.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ccooddeessiiggnn command is used to create, check, and display code signa-
     tures, as well as inquire into the dynamic status of signed code in the
     system.

     ccooddeessiiggnn requires exactly one _o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n option to determine what action
     is to be performed, as well as any number of other options to modify its
     behavior. It can act on any number of objects per invocation, but per-
     forms the same operation on all of them.

     ccooddeessiiggnn accepts single-character (classic) options, as well as GNU-style
     long options of the form --name and --name=value. Common options have
     both forms; less frequent and specialized options have only long form.
     Note that the form --name value (without equal sign) will not work as
     expected on options with optional values.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The options are as follows:

     ----aallll--aarrcchhiitteeccttuurreess
             When verifying a code signature on code that has a universal
             (""fat"") Mach-O binary, separately verify each architecture con-
             tained. This is the default unless overridden with the -a
             (--architecture) option.

     --aa,, ----aarrcchhiitteeccttuurree _a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e
             When verifying or displaying signatures, explicitly select the
             Mach-O architecture given. The _a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e can be specified
             either by name (e.g. i386) or by number; if by number, a sub-
             architecture may be appended separated by a comma.  This option
             applies only to Mach-O binary code and is ignored for other
             types.  If the _p_a_t_h uses the Mach-O format and contains no code
             of the given architecture, the command will fail.  The default
             for verification is --all-architectures, to verify all architec-
             tures present.  The default for display is to report on the
             native architecture of the host system.  When signing, ccooddeessiiggnn
             will always sign all architectures contained in a universal Mach-
             O file.

     ----bbuunnddllee--vveerrssiioonn _v_e_r_s_i_o_n_-_s_t_r_i_n_g
             When handling versioned bundles such as frameworks, explicitly
             specify the version to operate on. This must be one of the names
             in the ""Versions"" directory of the bundle.  If not specified,
             ccooddeessiiggnn uses the bundle's default version.  Note that most
             frameworks delivered with the system have only one version, and
             thus this option is irrelevant for them.  There is currently no
             facility for operating on all versions of a bundle at once.

     --dd,, ----ddiissppllaayy
             Display information about the code at the path(s) given. Increas-
             ing levels of verbosity produce more output.  The format is
             designed to be moderately easy to parse by simple scripts while
             still making sense to human eyes.  In addition, the -r, --file-
             list, --extract-certificates, and --entitlements options can be
             used to retrieve additional information.

     --DD,, ----ddeettaacchheedd _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
             When signing, designates that a detached signature should be
             written to the specified file. The code being signed is not modi-
             fied and need not be writable.  When verifying, designates a file
             containing a detached signature to be used for verification. Any
             embedded signature in the code is ignored.

     ----ddeeeepp  When signing a bundle, specifies that nested code content such as
             helpers, frameworks, and plug-ins, should be recursively signed
             in turn. Beware that all signing options you specify will apply,
             in turn, to such nested content.
             When verifying a bundle, specifies that any nested code content
             will be recursively verified as to its full content. By default,
             verification of nested content is limited to a shallow investiga-
             tion that may not detect changes to the nested code.
             When displaying a signature, specifies that a list of directly
             nested code should be written to the display output. This lists
             only code directly nested within the subject; anything nested
             indirectly will require recursive application of the ccooddeessiiggnn
             command.

     ----ddeettaacchheedd--ddaattaabbaassee
             When signing, specifies that a detached signature should be gen-
             erated as with the --detached option, but that the resulting sig-
             nature should be written into a system database, from where it is
             made automatically available whenever apparently unsigned code is
             validated on the system.
             Writing to this system database requires elevated process privi-
             leges that are not available to ordinary users.

     --ff,, ----ffoorrccee
             When signing, causes ccooddeessiiggnn to replace any existing signature
             on the path(s) given. Without this option, existing signatures
             will not be replaced, and the signing operation fails.

     --hh,, ----hhoossttiinngg
             Constructs and prints the hosting chain of a running program. The
             _p_i_d arguments must denote running code (pids etc.) With verbose
             options, this also displays the individual dynamic validity sta-
             tus of each element of the hosting chain.

     --ii,, ----iiddeennttiiffiieerr _i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r
             During signing, explicitly specify the unique identifier string
             that is embedded in code signatures. If this option is omitted,
             the identifier is derived from either the Info.plist (if
             present), or the filename of the executable being signed, possi-
             bly modified by the --prefix option.  It is a vveerryy bbaadd iiddeeaa to
             sign different programs with the same identifier.

     --oo,, ----ooppttiioonnss _f_l_a_g_,_._._.
             During signing, specifies a set of option flags to be embedded in
             the code signature. The value takes the form of a comma-separated
             list of names (with no spaces). Alternatively, a numeric value
             can be used to directly specify the option mask (CodeDirectory
             flag word). See OPTION FLAGS below.

     --PP,, ----ppaaggeessiizzee _p_a_g_e_s_i_z_e
             Indicates the granularity of code signing. Pagesize must be a
             power of two.  Chunks of pagesize bytes are separately signed and
             can thus be independently verified as needed.  As a special case,
             a pagesize of zero indicates that the entire code should be
             signed and verified as a single, possibly gigantic page. This
             option only applies to the main executable and has no effect on
             the sealing of associated data, including resources.

     --rr,, ----rreeqquuiirreemmeennttss _r_e_q_u_i_r_e_m_e_n_t_s
             During signing, indicates that internal requirements should be
             embedded in the code path(s) as specified. See ""specifying
             requirements"" below.  Defaults will be applied to requirement
             types that are not explicitly specified; if you want to defeat
             such a default, specify ""never"" for that type.
             During display, indicates where to write the code's internal
             requirements. Use -r- to write them to standard output.

     --RR,, ----tteesstt--rreeqquuiirreemmeenntt _r_e_q_u_i_r_e_m_e_n_t
             During verification, indicates that the path(s) given should be
             verified against the code requirement specified. If this option
             is omitted, the code is verified only for internal integrity and
             against its own designated requirement.

     --ss,, ----ssiiggnn _i_d_e_n_t_i_t_y
             Sign the code at the path(s) given using this identity. See SIGN-
             ING IDENTITIES below.

     --vv,, ----vveerrbboossee
             Sets (with a numeric value) or increments the verbosity level of
             output. Without the verbose option, no output is produced upon
             success, in the classic UNIX style.  If no other options request
             a different action, the first -v encountered will be interpreted
             as --verify instead (and does not increase verbosity).

     --vv,, ----vveerriiffyy
             Requests verification of code signatures.  If other actions
             (sign, display, etc.) are also requested, -v is interpreted to
             mean --verbose.

     ----ccoonnttiinnuuee
             Instructs ccooddeessiiggnn to continue processing path arguments even if
             processing one fails.  If this option is given, exit due to oper-
             ational errors is deferred until all path arguments have been
             considered. The exit code will then indicate the most severe
             failure (or, with equal severity, the first such failure encoun-
             tered).

     ----ddrryyrruunn
             During signing, performs almost all signing operations, but does
             not actually write the result anywhere. Cryptographic signatures
             are still generated, actually using the given signing identity
             and triggering any access control checks normally, though the
             resulting signature is then discarded.

     ----eennttiittlleemmeennttss _p_a_t_h
             When signing, take the file at the given _p_a_t_h and embed its con-
             tents in the signature as entitlement data. If the data at _p_a_t_h
             does not already begin with a suitable binary (""blob"") header,
             one is attached automatically.
             When displaying a signature, extract any entitlement data from
             the signature and write it to the _p_a_t_h given. Use ""-"" to write to
             standard output.  By default, the binary ""blob"" header is
             returned intact; prefix the path with a colon "":"" to automati-
             cally strip it off.  If the signature has no entitlement data,
             nothing is written (this is not an error).

     ----eexxttrraacctt--cceerrttiiffiiccaatteess _p_r_e_f_i_x
             When displaying a signature, extract the certificates in the
             embedded certificate chain and write them to individual files.
             The _p_r_e_f_i_x argument is appended with numbers 0, 1, ... to form
             the filenames, which can be relative or absolute. Certificate 0
             is the leaf (signing) certificate, and as many files are written
             as there are certificates in the signature. The files are in
             ASN.1 (DER) form.  If _p_r_e_f_i_x is omitted, the default prefix is
             ""codesign"" in the current directory.

     ----ffiillee--lliisstt _p_a_t_h
             When signing or displaying a signature, ccooddeessiiggnn writes to the
             given path a list of files that may have been modified as part of
             the signing process. This is useful for installer or patcher pro-
             grams that need to know what was changed or what files are needed
             to make up the ""signature"" of a program. The file given is
             appended-to, with one line per absolute path written. An argument
             of ""-"" (single dash) denotes standard output.  Note that the list
             may be somewhat pessimistic - all files not listed are guaranteed
             to be unchanged by the signing process, but some of the listed
             files may not actually have changed.  Also note that changes may
             have been made to extended attributes of these files.

     ----iiggnnoorree--rreessoouurrcceess
             During static validation, do not validate the contents of the
             code's resources.  In effect, this will pass validation on code
             whose resources have been corrupted (or inappropriately signed).
             On large programs, it will also substantially speed up static
             validation, since all the resources will not be read into memory.
             Obviously, the outcome of such a validation should be considered
             on its merits.

     ----kkeeyycchhaaiinn _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
             During signing, only search for the signing identity in the key-
             chain file specified. This can be used to break any matching ties
             if you have multiple similarly-named identities in several key-
             chains on the user's search list.  Note that the standard key-
             chain search path is still consulted while constructing the cer-
             tificate chain being embedded in the signature.
             Note that _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e will not be searched to resolve the signing
             identity's certificate chain unless it is also on the user's key-
             chain search list.

     ----pprreeffiixx _s_t_r_i_n_g
             If no explicit unique identifier is specified (using the -i
             option), and if the implicitly generated identifier does not con-
             tain any dot (.) characters, then the given string is prefixed to
             the identifier before use. If the implicit identifier contains a
             dot, it is used as-is. Typically, this is used to deal with com-
             mand tools without Info.plists, whose default identifier is sim-
             ply the command's filename; the conventional prefix used is
             com.domain. (note that the final dot needs to be explicit).

     ----pprreesseerrvvee--mmeettaaddaattaa==lliisstt
             When re-signing code that is already signed, reuse some informa-
             tion from the old signature.  If new data is specified explic-
             itly, it is preferred.  You still need to specify the -f
             (--force) option to enable overwriting signatures at all.  If
             this option is absent, any old signature has no effect on the
             signing process.
             This option takes a comma-separated list of names, which you may
             reasonably abbreviate:

             identifier    Preserve the signing identifier (--identifier)
                           instead of generating a default identifier.

             entitlements  Preserve the entitlement data (--entitlements).

             requirements  Preserve the internal requirements (--requirements
                           option), including any explicit Designated Require-
                           ment. Note that all internal requirements are pre-
                           served or regenerated as a whole; you cannot pick
                           and choose individual elements with this option.

             runtime       Preserve the hardened runtime version (-o runtime
                           flag, --runtime-version option) instead of overrid-
                           ing or deriving the version.
             For historical reasons, this option can be given without a value,
             which preserves all of these values as presently known. This use
             is deprecated and will eventually be removed; always specify an
             explicit list of preserved items.

     ----ssttrriicctt _o_p_t_i_o_n_s
             When validating code, apply additional restrictions beyond the
             defaults.

             symlinks  Check that symbolic links inside the code bundle point
                       to sealed files inside its bundle.  This means that
                       broken symbolic links are rejected, as are links to
                       places outside the bundle and to places that are not,
                       for whatever reason, sealed by the signature.

             sideband  Check that no resource forks, Finder attributes, or
                       similar sideband data is present in the signed code.
                       This is now automatically enforced by signing opera-
                       tions.
             Options can be specified as a comma-separated list. Use plain
             --strict or --strict=all to be as strict as possible. Note that
             --strict=all may include more checking types over time.
             Not all strictness check make sense in all circumstances, which
             is why these behaviors are not the defualt.

     ----ttiimmeessttaammpp [_=_U_R_L]
             During signing, requests that a _t_i_m_e_s_t_a_m_p _a_u_t_h_o_r_i_t_y _s_e_r_v_e_r be
             contacted to authenticate the time of signing. The server con-
             tacted is given by the _U_R_L value.  If this option is given with-
             out a value, a default server provided by Apple is used.  Note
             that this server may not support signatures made with identities
             not furnished by Apple.  If the timestamp authority service can-
             not be contacted over the Internet, or it malfunctions or refuses
             service, the signing operation will ffaaiill.
             If this option is not given at all, a system-specific default
             behavior is invoked.  This may result in some but not all code
             signatures being timestamped.
             The special value _n_o_n_e explicitly disables the use of timestamp

             specify the hardened runtime version stored in the code signa-
             ture.  If this option is omitted, but the _r_u_n_t_i_m_e OPTION FLAG is
             set then the hardened runtime version is omitted for non-Mach-O
             files and derived from the SDK version of Mach-O files.

     In the first synopsis form, ccooddeessiiggnn attempts to sign the code objects at
     the _p_a_t_h_(_s_) given, using the _i_d_e_n_t_i_t_y provided. Internal _r_e_q_u_i_r_e_m_e_n_t_s and
     _e_n_t_i_t_l_e_m_e_n_t_s are embedded if requested. Internal requirements not speci-
     fied may be assigned suitable default values. Defaulting applies sepa-
     rately to each type of internal requirement.  If an _i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r is explic-
     itly given, it is sealed into all _p_a_t_h_(_s_).  Otherwise, each path derives
     its _i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r independently from its Info.plist or pathname.  Code
     nested within bundle directories must already be signed or the signing
     operation will _f_a_i_l, unless the ----ddeeeepp option is given, in which case any
     unsigned nested code will be recursively signed before proceeding, using
     the same signing options and parameters. If the ----ffoorrccee option is given,
     any existing top-level signature is replaced, subject to any
     ----pprreesseerrvvee--mmeettaaddaattaa options also present. Combining the ----ffoorrccee and
     ----ddeeeepp options results in forcible replacement of all signatures within
     the target bundle.

     In the second synopsis form, ccooddeessiiggnn verifies the code signatures on all
     the _p_a_t_h_(_s_) given. The verification confirms that the code at those
     _p_a_t_h_(_s_) is signed, that the signature is valid, and that all sealed com-
     ponents are unaltered. If a _r_e_q_u_i_r_e_m_e_n_t is given, each _p_a_t_h is also
     checked against this requirement (but see DIAGNOSTICS below).  If verbose
     verification is requested, the program is also checked against its own
     designated requirement, which should never fail for a properly signed
     program.

     If a _p_a_t_h begins with a decimal digit, it is interpreted as the process
     id of a running process in the system, and dynamic validation is per-
     formed on that process instead.  This checks the code's dynamic status
     and just enough static data to close the nominal security envelope. Add
     at least one level of verbosity to also perform a full static check.

     In the third synopsis form, ccooddeessiiggnn displays the contents of the signa-
     tures on the _p_a_t_h_(_s_) given. More information is displayed as the ver-
     bosity level increases.  This form may not completely verify the signa-
     tures on the _p_a_t_h_(_s_); though it may perform some verification steps in
     the process of obtaining information about the _p_a_t_h_(_s_).  If the _-_r _p_a_t_h
     option is given, internal requirements will be extracted from the _p_a_t_h_(_s_)
     and written to _p_a_t_h; specify a dash ""-"" to write to standard output. If
     the code does not contain an explicit designated requirement, the implied
     one will be retrieved and written out as a source comment.  If the
     _-_-_e_n_t_i_t_l_e_m_e_n_t_s _p_a_t_h option is given, embedded entitlement data will be
     extracted likewise and written to the file specified.

     In the fourth synopsis form, ccooddeessiiggnn constructs the hosting path for
     each _p_i_d given and writes it, one host per line, to standard output. The
     hosting path is the chain of code signing hosts starting with the most
     specific code known to be running, and ending with the root of trust (the
     kernel). If the _-_-_v_e_r_b_o_s_e option is given, the dynamic validity status of
     each host is also displayed, separated from the path by a tab character.
     Note that hosting chains can at times be constructed for invalid or even
     unsigned code, and the output of this form of the ccooddeessiiggnn command should
     not be taken as a statement of formal code validity. Only ccooddeessiiggnn
     _-_-_v_e_r_i_f_y can do that; and in fact, formal verification constructs the
     hosting chain as part of its operation (but does not display it).

     To be used for code signing, a digital identity must be stored in a key-
     chain that is on the calling user's keychain search list.  All keychain
     sources are supported if properly configured. In particular, it is possi-
     ble to sign code with an identity stored on a supported smart card.  If
     your signing identity is stored in a different form, you need to make it
     available in keychain form to sign code with it.
     If the _-_-_k_e_y_c_h_a_i_n argument is used, _i_d_e_n_t_i_t_y is only looked-for in the
     specific keychain given. This is meant to help disambiguate references to
     identities.  Even in that case, the full keychain search list is still
     consulted for additional certificates needed to complete the signature.

     The _i_d_e_n_t_i_t_y is first considered as the full name of a kkeeyycchhaaiinn iiddeennttiittyy
     pprreeffeerreennccee.  If such a preference exists, it directly names the identity
     used.  Otherwise, the identity is located by searching all keychains for
     a certificate whose subject ccoommmmoonn nnaammee (only) contains the _i_d_e_n_t_i_t_y
     string given. If there are multiple matches, the operation fails and no
     signing is performed; however, an exact match is preferred over a partial
     match.  These comparisons are case sensitive.  Multiple instances of the
     exactly same certificate in multiple keychains are tolerated as harmless.

     If _i_d_e_n_t_i_t_y consists of exactly forty hexadecimal digits, it is instead
     interpreted as the SHA-1 hash of the certificate part of the desired
     identity.  In this case, the identity's subject name is not considered.

     Both iiddeennttiittyy pprreeffeerreenncceess and certificate hashes can be used to identify
     a particular signing identity regardless of name. Identity preferences
     are global settings _f_o_r _e_a_c_h _u_s_e_r and provide a layer of indirection.
     Certificate hashes are very explicit and local. These choices, combined
     with what is placed into Xcode project and target build variables and/or
     script settings, allows for very flexible designation of signing identi-
     ties.

     If _i_d_e_n_t_i_t_y is the single letter ""-"" (dash), aadd--hhoocc ssiiggnniinngg is performed.
     Ad-hoc signing does not use an identity at all, and identifies exactly
     one instance of code. Significant restrictions apply to the use of ad-hoc
     signed code; consult documentation before using this.

     ccooddeessiiggnn will attempt to embed the entire certificate chain documenting
     the signing identity in the code signature it generates, including any
     intermediate certificates and the anchor certificate. It looks for those
     in the keychain search list of the user performing the signing operation.
     If it cannot generate the entire certificate chain, signing may still
     succeed, but verification may fail if the verifying code does not have an
     independent source for the missing certificates (from _i_t_s keychains).

     The _r_e_q_u_i_r_e_m_e_n_t_(_s_) arguments (-r and -R) can be given in various forms. A
     plain text argument is taken to be a path to a file containing the
     requirement(s).  ccooddeessiiggnn will accept both binary files containing prop-
     erly compiled requirements code, and source files that are automatically
     compiled before use.  An argument of ""-"" requests that the requirement(s)
     are read from standard input.  Finally, an argument that begins with an
     equal sign ""="" is taken as a literal requirements source text, and is
     compiled accordingly for use.

OOPPTTIIOONN FFLLAAGGSS
     When signing, a set of option flags can be specified to change the behav-
     ior of the system when using the signed code. The following flags are
     recognized by ccooddeessiiggnn; other flags may exist at the API level. Note that
     you can specify any valid flags by giving a (single) numeric value
     instead of a list of option names.

     kill     Forces the signed code's kill flag to be set when the code
              begins execution.  Code with the kill flag set will die when it
              becomes dynamically invalid. It is therefore safe to assume that
              code marked this way, once validated, will have continue to have
              a valid identity while alive.

     hard     Forces the signed code's hard flag to be set when the code
              begins execution.  The hard flag is a hint to the system that
              the code prefers to be denied access to resources if gaining
              such access would invalidate its identity.

     host     Marks the code as capable of hosting guest code. You must set
              this option if you want the code to act as a code signing host,
              controlling subsidiary (""guest"") code. This flag is set automat-
              ically if you specify an internal guest requirement.

     expires  Forces any validation of the code to consider expiration of the
              certificates involved. Code signatures generated with this flag
              will fail to verify once any of the certificates in the chain
              has expired, regardless of the intentions of the verifier. Note
              that this flag does not affect any other checks that may cause
              signature validation to fail, including checks for certificate
              revocation.

     library  Forces the signed code's library validation flag to be set when
              the code begins execution.  The code will only be able to link
              against system libraries and frameworks, or libraries, frame-
              works, and plug-in bundles with the same team identifier embed-
              ded in the code directory.  Team identifiers are automatically
              recorded in signatures when signing with suitable Apple-issued
              signing certificates.  Note that the flag is not supported for
              i386 binaries, and only applies to the main executable.  The
              flag has no effect when set on frameworks and libraries.

     runtime  On macOS versions >= 10.14.0, opts signed processes into a hard-
              ened runtime environment which includes runtime code signing
              enforcement, library validation, hard, kill, and debugging
              restrictions.  These restrictions can be selectively relaxed via
              entitlements. Note: macOS versions older than 10.14.0 ignore the
              presence of this flag in the code signature.

     Note that code can set the hard and kill flags on itself at any time. The
     signing options only affect their initial state. Once set by any means,
     these flags cannot be cleared for the lifetime of the code. Therefore,
     specifying such flags as signing options guarantees that they will be set
     whenever the signed code runs.

     If the code being signed has an Info.plist that contains a key named
     CSFlags, the value of that key is taken as the default value for the
     options. The value of CSFlags can be a string in the same form as the
     --options option, or an integer number specifying the absolute numeric
     value. Note however that while you can abbreviate flag names on the com-
     mand lines, you must spell them out in the Info.plist.

     ccooddeessiiggnn exits 0 if all operations succeed. This indicates that all codes
     were signed, or all codes verified properly as requested. If a signing or
     verification operation fails, the exit code is 1. Exit code 2 indicates
     invalid arguments or parameters. Exit code 3 indicates that during veri-
     fication, all path(s) were properly signed but at least one of them
     failed to satisfy the requirement specified with the _-_R option.

     For verification, all path arguments are always investigated before the
     program exits.  For all other operations, the program exits upon the
     first error encountered, and any further path arguments are ignored,
     unless the --continue option was specified, in which case ccooddeessiiggnn will
     defer the failure exit until after it has attempted to process all path
     arguments in turn.

     When a signing operation fails for a particular code, the code may
     already have been modified in certain ways by adding requisite signature
     data. Such information will not change the operation of the code, and the
     code will not be considered signed even with these pieces in place. You
     may repeat the signing operation without difficulty.  Note however that a
     previous valid signature may have been effectively destroyed if you spec-
     ified the -f option.
     If you require atomicity of signing stricter than provided by ccooddeessiiggnn,
     you need to make an explicit copy of your code and sign that.

     If the CODESIGN_ALLOCATE environment variable is set, it identifies a

     vide architectural support for non-native platforms such as iPhones.  The

     with you if you need to make backward-compatible scripts.

     The dual meaning of the _-_v option, indicating either verbosity or verifi-
     cation, confuses some people. If you find it confusing, use the unambigu-

     ccooddeessiiggnn is fundamentally a shell around the code signing APIs, and per-
     forms nothing of the underlying work.  Replacing it with older or newer
     versions is unlikely to have a useful effect.

     ccooddeessiiggnn has several operations and options that are purposely left
     undocumented in this manual page because they are either experimental
     (and subject to change at any time), or unadvised to the unwary.  The
     interminably curious are referred to the published source code.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     RRoouuttee is a utility used to manually manipulate the network routing
     tables.  It normally is not needed, as a system routing table management
     daemon such as routed(8), should tend to this task.

     The rroouuttee utility supports a limited number of general options, but a
     rich command language, enabling the user to specify any arbitrary request
     that could be delivered via the programmatic interface discussed in
     route(4).

     The following options are available:

     --dd      Run in debug-only mode, i.e., do not actually modify the routing
             table.

     --nn      Bypass attempts to print host and network names symbolically when
             reporting actions.  (The process of translating between symbolic
             names and numerical equivalents can be quite time consuming, and
             may require correct operation of the network; thus it may be
             expedient to forget this, especially when attempting to repair
             networking operations).

     --tt      Run in test-only mode.  _/_d_e_v_/_n_u_l_l is used instead of a socket.

     --vv      (verbose) Print additional details.

     --qq      Suppress all output.

     The rroouuttee utility provides six commands:

     aadddd         Add a route.
     fflluusshh       Remove all routes.
     ddeelleettee      Delete a specific route.
     cchhaannggee      Change aspects of a route (such as its gateway).
     ggeett         Lookup and display the route for a destination.
     mmoonniittoorr     Continuously report any changes to the routing information
                 base, routing lookup misses, or suspected network partition-
                 ings.

     The monitor command has the syntax:

           rroouuttee [--nn] mmoonniittoorr

     The flush command has the syntax:

           rroouuttee [--nn] fflluusshh [_f_a_m_i_l_y]

     If the fflluusshh command is specified, rroouuttee will ``flush'' the routing
     tables of all gateway entries.  When the address family may is specified
     by any of the --oossii, --xxnnss, --aattaallkk, --iinneett66, or --iinneett modifiers, only routes
     having destinations with addresses in the delineated family will be
     deleted.

     The other commands have the following syntax:

           rroouuttee [--nn] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [--nneett | --hhoosstt] [--iiffssccooppee _b_o_u_n_d_i_f] _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n
           _g_a_t_e_w_a_y [_n_e_t_m_a_s_k]

     where _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n is the destination host or network, _g_a_t_e_w_a_y is the
     next-hop intermediary via which packets should be routed.  Routes to a
     particular host may be distinguished from those to a network by inter-
     preting the Internet address specified as the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n argument.  The
     optional modifiers --nneett and --hhoosstt force the destination to be interpreted
     as a network or a host, respectively.  Otherwise, if the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n has
     a ``local address part'' of INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0), or if the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n
     is the symbolic name of a network, then the route is assumed to be to a
     network; otherwise, it is presumed to be a route to a host.  Optionally,
     the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n could also be specified in the _n_e_t/_b_i_t_s format.

     For example, 128.32 is interpreted as --hhoosstt 128.0.0.32; 128.32.130 is
     interpreted as --hhoosstt 128.32.0.130; --nneett 128.32 is interpreted as
     128.32.0.0; --nneett 128.32.130 is interpreted as 128.32.130.0; and
     192.168.64/20 is interpreted as --nneett 192.168.64 --nneettmmaasskk 255.255.240.0.

     A _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n of _d_e_f_a_u_l_t is a synonym for --nneett 0.0.0.0, which is the
     default route.

     If the destination is directly reachable via an interface requiring no
     intermediary system to act as a gateway, the --iinntteerrffaaccee modifier should
     be specified; the gateway given is the address of this host on the common
     network, indicating the interface to be used for transmission.  Alter-
     nately, if the interface is point to point the name of the interface
     itself may be given, in which case the route remains valid even if the
     local or remote addresses change.

     For AF_INET and AF_INET6, the --iiffssccooppee modifier specifies the additional
     property of the route related to the interface scope derived from inter-
     face _b_o_u_n_d_i_f.  Such property allows for the presence of multiple route
     entries with the same destination, where each route is associated with a
     unique interface.  This modifier is required in order to manipulate route
     entries marked with the RTF_IFSCOPE flag.

     The optional modifier --lliinnkk specify that all subsequent addresses are
     specified as link-level addresses, and the names must be numeric specifi-
     cations rather than symbolic names.

     The optional --nneettmmaasskk modifier is intended to achieve the effect of an
     OSI ESIS redirect with the netmask option, or to manually add subnet
     routes with netmasks different from that of the implied network interface
     (as would otherwise be communicated using the OSPF or ISIS routing proto-
     cols).  One specifies an additional ensuing address parameter (to be
     interpreted as a network mask).  The implicit network mask generated in
     the AF_INET case can be overridden by making sure this option follows the
     destination parameter.

     For AF_INET6, the --pprreeffiixxlleenn qualifier is available instead of the --mmaasskk
     qualifier because non-continuous masks are not allowed in IPv6.  For
     example, --pprreeffiixxlleenn 32 specifies network mask of
     ffff:ffff:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to be used.  The default value of
     prefixlen is 64 to get along with the aggregatable address.  But 0 is
     assumed if ddeeffaauulltt is specified.  Note that the qualifier works only for
     AF_INET6 address family.

     Routes have associated flags which influence operation of the protocols
     when sending to destinations matched by the routes.  These flags may be
     set (or sometimes cleared) by indicating the following corresponding mod-
     ifiers:

     -cloning   RTF_CLONING    - generates a new route on use
     -xresolve  RTF_XRESOLVE   - emit mesg on use (for external lookup)
     -iface    ~RTF_GATEWAY    - destination is directly reachable
     -static    RTF_STATIC     - manually added route
     -nostatic ~RTF_STATIC     - pretend route added by kernel or daemon
     -reject    RTF_REJECT     - emit an ICMP unreachable when matched
     -blackhole RTF_BLACKHOLE  - silently discard pkts (during updates)
     -proto1    RTF_PROTO1     - set protocol specific routing flag #1
     -proto2    RTF_PROTO2     - set protocol specific routing flag #2
     -llinfo    RTF_LLINFO     - validly translates proto addr to link addr

     The optional modifiers --rrtttt, --rrttttvvaarr, --sseennddppiippee, --rreeccvvppiippee, --mmttuu,
     --hhooppccoouunntt, --eexxppiirree, and --sssstthhrreesshh provide initial values to quantities
     maintained in the routing entry by transport level protocols, such as TCP
     or TP4.  These may be individually locked by preceding each such modifier
     to be locked by the --lloocckk meta-modifier, or one can specify that all
     ensuing metrics may be locked by the --lloocckkrreesstt meta-modifier.

     In a cchhaannggee or aadddd command where the destination and gateway are not suf-
     ficient to specify the route (as in the ISO case where several interfaces
     may have the same address), the --iiffpp or --iiffaa modifiers may be used to
     determine the interface or interface address.

     The optional --pprrooxxyy modifier specifies that the RTF_LLINFO routing table
     entry is the ``published (proxy-only)'' ARP entry, as reported by arp(8).

     All symbolic names specified for a _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n or _g_a_t_e_w_a_y are looked up
     first as a host name using gethostbyname(3).  If this lookup fails,
     getnetbyname(3) is then used to interpret the name as that of a network.

     RRoouuttee uses a routing socket and the new message types RTM_ADD,
     RTM_DELETE, RTM_GET, and RTM_CHANGE.  As such, only the super-user may
     modify the routing tables.

       The  XAR  project  aims to provide an easily extensible archive format.
       Important design decisions include an easily extensible  XML  table  of
       contents  (TOC) for random access to archived files, storing the TOC at
       the beginning of  the  archive  to  allow  for  efficient  handling  of
       streamed  archives,  the  ability  to handle files of arbitrarily large
       sizes, the ability to choose independent encodings for individual files
       in  the archive, the ability to store checksums for individual files in
       both compressed and uncompressed form, and the ability to query the ta-
       ble of content's rich meta-data.

       --compression
              Specifies the compression type  to  use.   Valid  values:  none,
              gzip, bzip2, lzma (on some systems).  Default value: gzip

       -C <path>
              On extract, xar will chdir to the specified path before extract-
              ing the archive.

       -a     Synonym for --compression=lzma

       -j     Synonym for --compression=bzip2

       -z     Synonym for --compression=gzip

       --compression-args=<arguments>
              Specifies arguments to the compression engine  selected.   gzip,
              bzip2, and lzma all take a single integer argument between 0 and
              9 specifying the compression level to use.

       --dump-toc=<filename>
              Has xar dump the xml header into the specified file.  ""-"" can be
              specified to mean stdout.

       --dump-toc-cksum
              Dumps the ToC checksum to stdout along with the algorithm of the
              ToC.

       --dump-header
              Has xar print out the xar binary header information to stdout.

       --extract-subdoc=<name>
              Extracts the specified subdocument to a document  in  cwd  named
              <name>.xml

       --list-subdocs
              List the subdocuments in the xml header

       --toc-cksum
              Specifies  the hashing algorithm to use for xml header verifica-
              tion.  Valid values: md5 (on some systems),  sha1,  sha256,  and
              sha512.  Default value: sha1

       --file-cksum
              Specifies  the hashing algorithm to use for file content verifi-
              cation.  Valid values: md5 (on some systems), sha1, sha256,  and
              sha512.  Default value: sha1

       -l     On archival, stay on the local device.

       -P     On  extract, set ownership based on uid/gid.  If the uid/gid can
              be set on the extracted file, setuid/setgid bits  will  also  be
              preserved.

       -p     On  extract, set ownership based on symbolic names, if possible.
              If the uid/gid can be set on the extracted  file,  setuid/setgid
              bits will also be preserved.

       -s <filename>
              On  extract,  specifies the file to extract subdocuments to.  On
              archival, specifies an xml file to add as a subdocument.

       -v     Verbose output

       --exclude
              Specifies a POSIX regular expression of files  to  exclude  from
              adding  to  the  archive during creation or from being extracted
              during extraction.  This option can be specified multiple times.

       --rsize
              Specifies  a size (in bytes) for the internal libxar read buffer
              while performing I/O.

       --coalesce-heap
              When multiple files in the archive are identical, only store one
              copy  of  the  data in the heap.  This creates smaller archives,
              but the archives created are not streamable.

       --link-same
              When the data section of multiple files are identical,  hardlink
              them within the archive.

       --no-compress
              Specifies  a  POSIX  regular expression of files to archive, but
              not compress.  The archived files will be copied  raw  into  the
              archive.  This can be used to exclude already gzipped files from
              being gzipped during the archival process.

       --prop-include
              Specifies a file property to be included in the  archive.   When
              this  option  is  specified,  only the specified options will be
              included.  Anything not specifically included with  this  option
              will be omitted.  This option can be used multiple times.

       --prop-exclude
              Specifies a file property to be excluded from the archive.  When
              this option is specified, all file properties will  be  included
              except the specified properties.  This option can be used multi-
              ple times.

       --distribution
              Creates an archive to only contain file properties safe for file
              distribution.   Currently,  only  name, type, mode, and data are
              preserved with this option.

       --keep-existing
              Does not overwrite existing files during extraction.  Keeps  any
              previously existing files while extracting.

       -k     Synonym for --keep-existing.

       --keep-setuid
              When extracting without -p or -P options, xar will extract files
              as the uid/gid of the extracting process.   In  this  situation,
              xar  will  strip setuid/setgid bits from the extracted files for
              security reasons.  --keep-setuid will preserve the setuid/setgid
              bits  even  though  the uid/gid of the extracted file is not the
              same as the archived file.

`locate {{pattern}}`

- Look for a file by its exact filename (a pattern containing no globbing characters is interpreted as `*pattern*`):

`locate */{{filename}}`

     llooccaattee [--00SScciimmss] [--ll _l_i_m_i_t] [--dd _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e] _p_a_t_t_e_r_n _._._.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The llooccaattee program searches a database for all pathnames which match the
     specified _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  The database is recomputed periodically (usually
     weekly or daily), and contains the pathnames of all files which are pub-
     licly accessible.

     Shell globbing and quoting characters (``*'', ``?'', ``\'', ``['' and
     ``]'') may be used in _p_a_t_t_e_r_n, although they will have to be escaped from
     the shell.  Preceding any character with a backslash (``\'') eliminates
     any special meaning which it may have.  The matching differs in that no
     characters must be matched explicitly, including slashes (``/'').

     As a special case, a pattern containing no globbing characters (``foo'')
     is matched as though it were ``*foo*''.

     Historically, locate only stored characters between 32 and 127.  The cur-
     rent implementation store any character except newline (`\n') and NUL
     (`\0').  The 8-bit character support does not waste extra space for plain
     ASCII file names.  Characters less than 32 or greater than 127 are stored
     in 2 bytes.

     The following options are available:

     --00          Print pathnames separated by an ASCII NUL character (charac-
                 ter code 0) instead of default NL (newline, character code
                 10).

     --SS          Print some statistics about the database and exit.

     --cc          Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching
                 file names.

     --dd _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e
                 Search in _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e instead of the default file name database.
                 Multiple --dd options are allowed.  Each additional --dd option
                 adds the specified database to the list of databases to be
                 searched.

                 The option _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e may be a colon-separated list of data-
                 bases.  A single colon is a reference to the default data-

                       $ locate -d db1 -d db2 -d db3 pattern

                 or

                       $ locate -d db1:db2 -d db3 pattern

                 If -- is given as the database name, standard input will be
                 read instead.  For example, you can compress your database
                 and use:

                 $ zcat database.gz | locate -d - pattern

                 This might be useful on machines with a fast CPU and little
                 RAM and slow I/O.  Note: you can only use _o_n_e pattern for
                 stdin.

     --ii          Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the data-

     --mm          Use mmap(2) instead of the stdio(3) library.  This is the
                 default behavior and is faster in most cases.

     The llooccaattee command first appeared in 4.4BSD.  Many new features were
     added in FreeBSD 2.2.

BBUUGGSS
     The llooccaattee program may fail to list some files that are present, or may
     list files that have been removed from the system.  This is because
     locate only reports files that are present in the database, which is typ-
     ically only regenerated once a week by the
     _/_S_y_s_t_e_m_/_L_i_b_r_a_r_y_/_L_a_u_n_c_h_D_a_e_m_o_n_s_/_c_o_m_._a_p_p_l_e_._l_o_c_a_t_e_._p_l_i_s_t job.  Use find(1) to
     locate files that are of a more transitory nature.

     The llooccaattee database is typically built by user ``nobody'' and the
     locate.updatedb(8) utility skips directories which are not readable for
     user ``nobody'', group ``nobody'', or world.  For example, if your HOME
     directory is not world-readable, _n_o_n_e of your files are in the database.

     The llooccaattee database is not byte order independent.  It is not possible to
     share the databases between machines with different byte order.  The cur-
     rent llooccaattee implementation understands databases in host byte order or
     network byte order if both architectures use the same integer size.  So
     on a FreeBSD/i386 machine (little endian), you can read a locate database
     which was built on SunOS/sparc machine (big endian, net).

     The llooccaattee utility does not recognize multibyte characters.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     oossaassccrriipptt executes the given OSA script, which may be plain text or a
     compiled script (.scpt) created by Script Editor or osacompile(1).  By
     default, oossaassccrriipptt treats plain text as AppleScript, but you can change
     this using the --ll option.  To get a list of the OSA languages installed
     on your system, use osalang(1).

     oossaassccrriipptt will look for the script in one of the following three places:

     1.   Specified line by line using --ee switches on the command line.

     2.   Contained in the file specified by the first filename on the command
          line.  This file may be plain text or a compiled script.

     3.   Passed in using standard input.  This works only if there are no
          filename arguments; to pass arguments to a STDIN-read script, you
          must explicitly specify ``-'' for the script name.

     Any arguments following the script will be passed as a list of strings to
     the direct parameter of the ``run'' handler.  For example, in Apple-
     Script:

           _a_._s_c_p_t_:
           on run argv
               return ""hello, "" & item 1 of argv & "".""
           end run

           %% oossaassccrriipptt aa..ssccpptt wwoorrlldd
           hello, world.

     The options are as follows:

     --ee _s_t_a_t_e_m_e_n_t
           Enter one line of a script.  If --ee is given, oossaassccrriipptt will not
           look for a filename in the argument list.  Multiple --ee options may
           be given to build up a multi-line script.  Because most scripts use
           characters that are special to many shell programs (for example,
           AppleScript uses single and double quote marks, ``('', ``)'', and
           ``*''), the statement will have to be correctly quoted and escaped
           to get it past the shell intact.

     --ii    Interactive mode: oossaassccrriipptt will prompt for one line at a time, and
           print the result, if applicable, after each line.  Any script sup-
           plied as a command argument using --ee or _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_f_i_l_e will be loaded,
           but not executed, before starting the interactive prompt.

     --ll _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e
           Override the language for any plain text files.  Normally, plain
           text files are compiled as AppleScript.

     --ss _f_l_a_g_s
           Modify the output style.  The _f_l_a_g_s argument is a string consisting
           of any of the modifier characters ee, hh, oo, and ss.  Multiple modi-
           fiers can be concatenated in the same string, and multiple --ss
           options can be specified.  The modifiers come in exclusive pairs;
           if conflicting modifiers are specified, the last one takes prece-
           dence.  The meanings of the modifier characters are as follows:

           hh  Print values in human-readable form (default).
           ss  Print values in recompilable source form.

              oossaassccrriipptt normally prints its results in human-readable form:
              strings do not have quotes around them, characters are not
              escaped, braces for lists and records are omitted, etc.  This is
              generally more useful, but can introduce ambiguities.  For exam-
              ple, the lists `{""foo"", ""bar""}' and `{{""foo"", {""bar""}}}' would
              both be displayed as `foo, bar'.  To see the results in an unam-
              biguous form that could be recompiled into the same value, use
              the ss modifier.

           ee  Print script errors to stderr (default).
           oo  Print script errors to stdout.

              oossaassccrriipptt normally prints script errors to stderr, so downstream
              clients only see valid results.  When running automated tests,
              however, using the oo modifier lets you distinguish script
              errors, which you care about matching, from other diagnostic
              output, which you don't.

           If markup is not specified, it defaults to ssmmssoo, i.e. reverse

       If the input is a TTY, text is spoken line by line, and the output
       file, if specified, will only contain audio for the last line of the
       input.  Otherwise, text is spoken all at once.

AAUUDDIIOO FFOORRMMAATTSS
       Starting in MacOS X 10.6, file formats other than AIFF may be
       specified, although not all third party synthesizers may initially
       support them. In simple cases, the file format can be inferred from the
       extension, although generally some of the options below are required
       for finer grained control:

       ----ffiillee--ffoorrmmaatt=format
           The format of the file to write (AIFF, caff, m4af, WAVE).
           Generally, it's easier to specify a suitable file extension for the
           output file. To obtain a list of writable file formats, specify '?'
           as the format name.

       ----ddaattaa--ffoorrmmaatt=format
           The format of the audio data to be stored. Formats other than
           linear PCM are specified by giving their format identifiers (aac,
           alac). Linear PCM formats are specified as a sequence of:

           Endianness (optional)
               One of BBEE (big endian) or LLEE (little endian). Default is native
               endianness.

           Data type
               One of FF (float), II (integer), or, rarely, UUII (unsigned
               integer).

           Sample size
               One of 88, 1166, 2244, 3322, 6644.

           Most available file formats only support a subset of these sample
           formats.

           To obtain a list of audio data formats for a file format specified
           explicitly or by file name, specify '?' as the format name.

           The format identifier optionally can be followed by @@ssaammpplleerraattee and
           //hheexxffllaaggss for the format.

       ----cchhaannnneellss=channels
           The number of channels. This will generally be of limited use, as
           most speech synthesizers produce mono audio only.

       ----bbiitt--rraattee=rate
           The bit rate for formats like AAC. To obtain a list of valid bit
           rates, specify '?' as the rate. In practice, not all of these bit
           rates will be available for a given format.

       ----qquuaalliittyy=quality
           The audio converter quality level between 0 (lowest) and 127
           (highest).
