REBOOT(8)                 BSD System Manager's Manual                REBOOT(8)

NNAAMMEE
     hhaalltt, rreebboooott -- stopping and restarting the system

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
     hhaalltt [--llnnqquu]
     rreebboooott [--llnnqq]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The hhaalltt and rreebboooott utilities flush the file system cache to disk, send
     all running processes a SIGTERM (and subsequently a SIGKILL) and, respec-
     tively, halt or restart the system.  The action is logged, including
     entering a shutdown record into the wtmp(5) file.

     When the system is halted with the halt command, the system is powered
     off.

     The options are as follows:

     --ll      The halt or reboot is _n_o_t recorded in the system log.  This
             option is intended for applications such as shutdown(8), that
             call rreebboooott or hhaalltt and log this themselves.

     --nn      The file system cache is not flushed.  This option should proba-
             bly not be used.

     --qq      The system is halted or restarted quickly and ungracefully, and
             only the flushing of the file system cache is performed (if the
             --nn option is not specified).  This option should probably not be
             used.

     --uu      The system is halted up until the point of removing system power,
             but waits before removing power for 5 minutes so that an external
             UPS (uninterruptible power supply) can forcibly remove power.
             This simulates a dirty shutdown to permit a later automatic power
             on. OS X uses this mode automatically with supported UPSs in
             emergency shutdowns.

     Normally, the shutdown(8) utility is used when the system needs to be
     halted or restarted, giving users advance warning of their impending doom
     and cleanly terminating specific programs.

SSIIGGTTEERRMM TTOO SSIIGGKKIILLLL IINNTTEERRVVAALL
     The SIGKILL will follow the SIGTERM by an intentionally indeterminate
     period of time.  Programs are expected to take only enough time to flush
     all dirty data and exit.  Developers are encouraged to file a bug with
     the OS vendor, should they encounter an issue with this functionality.

       The tool apt, annotation processing tool, includes a set of new reflec-
       tive APIs and supporting infrastructure to process program annotations.
       The apt reflective APIs provide a build-time,  source-based,  read-only
       view  of  program  structure.  These  reflective  APIs  are designed to
       cleanly model the JavaTM programming language's type system  after  the
       addition  of  generics.  First, apt runs annotation processors that can
       produce new source code and other files. Next, apt can  cause  compila-
       tion  of  both original and generated source files, easing development.
       The reflective APIs and other APIs used to interact with the  tool  are
       subpackages of com.sun.mirror.

       A  fuller  discussion  of how the tool operates as well as instructions
       for  developing  with  apt  are  in  Getting  Started   with   apt   at

       As  of  Xcode  8.0  the default _n_m(1) tool is _l_l_v_m_-_n_m(1).  They for the
       most part have the same options except for --ff and --ss which the  differ-
       ences are noted below.  More help on options for _l_l_v_m_-_n_m(1) is provided
       when running it with the ----hheellpp option.

       _N_m displays the name list (symbol table of nlist  structures)  of  each
       object  _f_i_l_e  in  the  argument list.  In some cases, as with an object
       that has had _s_t_r_i_p(1) with its --TT option used on the object,  that  can
       be different than the dyld information.  For that information use _d_y_l_d_-
       _i_n_f_o(1).

       If an argument is an archive, a listing for each object file in the ar-
       chive  will be produced.  _F_i_l_e can be of the form libx.a(x.o), in which
       case only symbols from that member of the object file are listed.  (The
       parentheses  have  to  be  quoted  to get by the shell.)  If no _f_i_l_e is
       given, the symbols in _a_._o_u_t are listed.

       Each symbol name is  preceded  by  its  value  (blanks  if  undefined).
       Unless the --mm option is specified, this value is followed by one of the
       following characters, representing the symbol type:  UU  (undefined),  AA
       (absolute),  TT  (text  section symbol), DD (data section symbol), BB (bss
       section symbol), CC  (common  symbol),  --  (for  debugger  symbol  table
       entries; see --aa below), SS (symbol in a section other than those above),
       or II (indirect symbol).  If the symbol  is  local  (non-external),  the
       symbol's  type  is  instead  represented by the corresponding lowercase
       letter.  A lower case uu in a dynamic shared library indicates  a  unde-
       fined  reference  to  a  private external in another module in the same
       library.

       If  the  symbol  is  a  Objective  C  method,  the   symbol   name   is
       ++--[[_C_l_a_s_s___n_a_m_e_(_c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y___n_a_m_e_)  _m_e_t_h_o_d_:_n_a_m_e_:]],  where  `+'  is  for class
       methods, `-' is for instance methods, and  _(_c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y___n_a_m_e_)  is  present
       only when the method is in a category.

       The output is sorted alphabetically by default.

       Options are:

       --aa     Display  all  symbol table entries, including those inserted for
              use by debuggers.

       --gg     Display only global (external) symbols.

       --nn     Sort numerically rather than alphabetically.

       --oo     Prepend file or archive element name to each output line, rather
              than only once.

       --pp     Don't sort; display in symbol-table order.

       --rr     Sort in reverse order.

       --uu     Display only undefined symbols.

       --UU     Don't display undefined symbols.

       --mm     Display  the  N_SECT  type  symbols  (Mach-O  symbols)  as (_s_e_g_-

              _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l  and then the symbol name.  Undefined, common, absolute
              and indirect symbols get  displayed  as  _(_u_n_d_e_f_i_n_e_d_),  _(_c_o_m_m_o_n_),
              _(_a_b_s_o_l_u_t_e_), and _(_i_n_d_i_r_e_c_t_), respectively.

       --xx     Display  the  symbol  table entry's fields in hexadecimal, along
              with the name as a string.

       --jj     Just display the symbol names (no value or type).

       --ss _s_e_g_n_a_m_e _s_e_c_t_n_a_m_e
              List only those symbols in the section _(_s_e_g_n_a_m_e_,_s_e_c_t_n_a_m_e_)_.   For
              _l_l_v_m_-_n_m(1)  this  option  must  be last on the command line, and
              after the files.

       --ll     List a pseudo symbol _._s_e_c_t_i_o_n___s_t_a_r_t if  no  symbol  has  as  its
              value  the  starting address of the section.  (This is used with
              the --ss option above.)

       --aarrcchh _a_r_c_h___t_y_p_e
              Specifies the architecture, _a_r_c_h___t_y_p_e_, of the file for _n_m(1)  to
              operate  on  when  the file is a universal file (see _a_r_c_h(3) for
              the currently known _a_r_c_h___t_y_p_es).  The _a_r_c_h___t_y_p_e can be ""all""  to
              operate  on  all  architectures  in the file.  The default is to
              display the symbols from only the host architecture, if the file
              contains  it;  otherwise,  symbols  for all architectures in the
              file are displayed.

       --ff  ffoorrmmaatt
              For _l_l_v_m_-_n_m(1) this specifies the output format.   Where  format
              can be bsd, sysv, posix or darwin.

       --ff     For  _n_m_-_c_l_a_s_s_i_c(1)  this  displays the symbol table of a dynamic
              library flat (as one file not separate modules).  This is  obso-
              lete and not supported with _l_l_v_m_-_n_m_(_1_)_.

       --AA     Write the pathname or library name of an object on each line.

       --PP     Write information in a portable output format.

              For the --PP output, write the numeric value in the specified for-
              mat. The format shall be dependent on the single character  used
              as the format option-argument:

     IP is the transport layer protocol used by the Internet protocol family.
     Options may be set at the IP level when using higher-level protocols that
     are based on IP (such as TCP and UDP).  It may also be accessed through a
     ``raw socket'' when developing new protocols, or special-purpose applica-
     tions.

     There are several IP-level setsockopt(2) /getsockopt(2) options.
     IP_OPTIONS may be used to provide IP options to be transmitted in the IP
     header of each outgoing packet or to examine the header options on incom-
     ing packets.  IP options may be used with any socket type in the Internet
     family.  The format of IP options to be sent is that specified by the IP
     protocol specification (RFC-791), with one exception: the list of
     addresses for Source Route options must include the first-hop gateway at
     the beginning of the list of gateways.  The first-hop gateway address
     will be extracted from the option list and the size adjusted accordingly
     before use.  To disable previously specified options, use a zero-length
     buffer:

     setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_OPTIONS, NULL, 0);

     IP_TOS and IP_TTL may be used to set the type-of-service and time-to-live
     fields in the IP header for SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM sockets. For exam-
     ple,

     int tos = IPTOS_LOWDELAY;       /* see <netinet/in.h> */
     setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_TOS, &tos, sizeof(tos));

     int ttl = 60;                   /* max = 255 */
     setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_TTL, &ttl, sizeof(ttl));

     If the IP_RECVDSTADDR option is enabled on a SOCK_DGRAM socket, the
     recvmsg call will return the destination IP address for a UDP datagram.
     The msg_control field in the msghdr structure points to a buffer that
     contains a cmsghdr structure followed by the IP address.  The cmsghdr
     fields have the following values:

     cmsg_len = CMSG_LEN(sizeof(struct in_addr))
     cmsg_level = IPPROTO_IP
     cmsg_type = IP_RECVDSTADDR

     If the IP_RECVTOS option is enabled on a SOCK_DGRAM or SOCK_RAW socket,
     the recvmsg call will return the TOS (type of service) field of the IP
     header.  The msg_control field in the msghdr structure points to a buffer
     that contains a cmsghdr structure followed by the TOS.  The cmsghdr
     fields have the following values:

     cmsg_len = CMSG_LEN(sizeof(u_char))
     cmsg_level = IPPROTO_IP
     cmsg_type = IP_RECVTOS

   MMuullttiiccaasstt OOppttiioonnss
     IP multicasting is supported only on AF_INET sockets of type SOCK_DGRAM
     and SOCK_RAW, and only on networks where the interface driver supports
     multicasting.

     The IP_MULTICAST_TTL option changes the time-to-live (TTL) for outgoing
     multicast datagrams in order to control the scope of the multicasts:

     u_char ttl;     /* range: 0 to 255, default = 1 */
     setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_MULTICAST_TTL, &ttl, sizeof(ttl));

     Datagrams with a TTL of 1 are not forwarded beyond the local network.
     Multicast datagrams with a TTL of 0 will not be transmitted on any net-
     work, but may be delivered locally if the sending host belongs to the
     destination group and if multicast loopback has not been disabled on the
     sending socket (see below).  Multicast datagrams with TTL greater than 1
     may be forwarded to other networks if a multicast router is attached to
     the local network.

     For hosts with multiple interfaces, each multicast transmission is sent
     from the primary network interface.  The IP_MULTICAST_IF option overrides
     the default for subsequent transmissions from a given socket:

     struct in_addr addr;
     setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_MULTICAST_IF, &addr, sizeof(addr));

     where ""addr"" is the local IP address of the desired interface or
     INADDR_ANY to specify the default interface.  An interface's local IP
     address and multicast capability can be obtained via the SIOCGIFCONF and
     SIOCGIFFLAGS ioctls.  Normal applications should not need to use this
     option.

     If a multicast datagram is sent to a group to which the sending host
     itself belongs (on the outgoing interface), a copy of the datagram is, by
     default, looped back by the IP layer for local delivery.  The
     IP_MULTICAST_LOOP option gives the sender explicit control over whether
     or not subsequent datagrams are looped back:

     u_char loop;    /* 0 = disable, 1 = enable (default) */
     setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_MULTICAST_LOOP, &loop, sizeof(loop));

     This option improves performance for applications that may have no more
     than one instance on a single host (such as a router demon), by eliminat-
     ing the overhead of receiving their own transmissions.  It should gener-
     ally not be used by applications for which there may be more than one
     instance on a single host (such as a conferencing program) or for which
     the sender does not belong to the destination group (such as a time
     querying program).

     A multicast datagram sent with an initial TTL greater than 1 may be
     delivered to the sending host on a different interface from that on which
     it was sent, if the host belongs to the destination group on that other
     interface.  The loopback control option has no effect on such delivery.

     A host must become a member of a multicast group before it can receive
     datagrams sent to the group.  To join a multicast group, use the
     IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP option:

     struct ip_mreq mreq;
     setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, &mreq, sizeof(mreq));

     where _m_r_e_q is the following structure:

     struct ip_mreq {
         struct in_addr imr_multiaddr; /* multicast group to join */
         struct in_addr imr_interface; /* interface to join on */
     }

     imr_interface should be INADDR_ANY to choose the default multicast inter-
     face, or the IP address of a particular multicast-capable interface if
     the host is multihomed.  Membership is associated with a single inter-
     face; programs running on multihomed hosts may need to join the same
     group on more than one interface.  Up to IP_MAX_MEMBERSHIPS (currently
     20) memberships may be added on a single socket.

     To drop a membership, use:

     struct ip_mreq mreq;
     setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP, &mreq, sizeof(mreq));

     where _m_r_e_q contains the same values as used to add the membership.  Mem-
     berships are dropped when the socket is closed or the process exits.

   RRaaww IIPP SSoocckkeettss
     Raw IP sockets are connectionless, and are normally used with the sendto
     and recvfrom calls, though the connect(2) call may also be used to fix
     the destination for future packets (in which case the read(2) or recv(2)
     and write(2) or send(2) system calls may be used).

     If _p_r_o_t_o is 0, the default protocol IPPROTO_RAW is used for outgoing
     packets, and only incoming packets destined for that protocol are
     received.  If _p_r_o_t_o is non-zero, that protocol number will be used on
     outgoing packets and to filter incoming packets.

     Outgoing packets automatically have an IP header prepended to them (based
     on the destination address and the protocol number the socket is created
     with), unless the IP_HDRINCL option has been set.  Incoming packets are
     received with IP header and options intact.

     IP_HDRINCL indicates the complete IP header is included with the data and
     may be used only with the SOCK_RAW type.

     #include <netinet/ip.h>

     int hincl = 1;                  /* 1 = on, 0 = off */
     setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_HDRINCL, &hincl, sizeof(hincl));

     Unlike previous BSD releases, the program must set all the fields of the
     IP header, including the following:

     ip->ip_v = IPVERSION;
     ip->ip_hl = hlen >> 2;
     ip->ip_id = 0;  /* 0 means kernel set appropriate value */
     ip->ip_off = offset;
     ip->ip_len = len;

     Note that the ip_off and ip_len fields are in host byte order.

     If the header source address is set to INADDR_ANY, the kernel will choose
     an appropriate address.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The mmkknnoodd command creates device special files.

     To make nodes manually, the required arguments are:

     _n_a_m_e    Device name, for example ``sd'' for a SCSI disk on an HP300 or a
             ``pty'' for pseudo-devices.

     bb | cc | ww
             Type of device. If the device is a block type device such as a
             tape or disk drive which needs both cooked and raw special files,
             the type is bb.  Whiteout nodes are type ww.  All other devices are
             character type devices, such as terminal and pseudo devices, and
             are type cc.

     _m_a_j_o_r   The major device number is an integer number which tells the ker-
             nel which device driver entry point to use.

     _m_i_n_o_r   The minor device number tells the kernel which one of several
             similar devices the node corresponds to; for example, it may be a
             specific serial port or pty.

     _u_n_i_t _a_n_d _s_u_b_u_n_i_t
             The unit and subunit numbers select a subset of a device; for
             example, the unit may specify a particular SCSI disk, and the
             subunit a partition on that disk.  (Currently this form of speci-
             fication is only supported by the _b_s_d_o_s format, for compatibility
             with the BSD/OS mknod(8).)

     Device numbers for different operating systems may be packed in a differ-
     ent format.  To create device nodes that may be used by such an operating
     system (e.g. in an exported file system used for netbooting), the --FF
     option is used.  The following formats are recognized: native, 386bsd,
     4bsd, bsdos, freebsd, hpux, isc, linux, netbsd, osf1, sco, solaris,
     sunos, svr3, svr4 and ultrix.

     Alternatively, a single opaque device number may be specified.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g program is used to retrieve information about installed
       libraries in the system.  It is typically  used  to  compile  and  link
       against  one  or more libraries.  Here is a typical usage scenario in a
       Makefile:

       program: program.c
            cc program.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs gnomeui`

       _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g retrieves information about packages from  special  metadata
       files.  These  files  are named after the package, and has a _._p_c exten-
       sion.   On  most  systems,  _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g  looks  in   _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b_/_p_k_g_c_o_n_f_i_g_,
       _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_p_k_g_c_o_n_f_i_g_,            _/_u_s_r_/_l_o_c_a_l_/_l_i_b_/_p_k_g_c_o_n_f_i_g           and
       _/_u_s_r_/_l_o_c_a_l_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_p_k_g_c_o_n_f_i_g for these files.  It will additionally  look
       in the colon-separated (on Windows, semicolon-separated) list of direc-
       tories specified by the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.

       The package name specified on the _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g command line is defined to
       be the name of the metadata file, minus the _._p_c extension. If a library
       can install multiple versions simultaneously, it must give each version
       its  own  name (for example, GTK 1.2 might have the package name ""gtk+""
       while GTK 2.0 has ""gtk+-2.0"").

       In addition to specifying a package name on the command line, the  full
       path  to  a  given _._p_c file may be given instead. This allows a user to
       directly query a particular _._p_c file.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The following options are supported:

       _-_-_m_o_d_v_e_r_s_i_o_n
              Requests that the version information of the libraries specified
              on  the  command  line be displayed.  If _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g can find all
              the libraries on the command line, each library's version string
              is  printed  to  stdout, one version per line. In this case _p_k_g_-
              _c_o_n_f_i_g exits successfully. If one or more libraries is  unknown,
              _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g exits with a nonzero code, and the contents of stdout
              are undefined.

       _-_-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n
              Displays the version of _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g and terminates.

       _-_-_a_t_l_e_a_s_t_-_p_k_g_c_o_n_f_i_g_-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n_=_V_E_R_S_I_O_N
              Requires at least the given version of pkg-config.

       _-_-_h_e_l_p Displays a help message and terminates.

       _-_-_p_r_i_n_t_-_e_r_r_o_r_s
              If one or more of the modules on  the  command  line,  or  their
              dependencies,  are not found, or if an error occurs in parsing a
              _._p_c file, then this option  will  cause  errors  explaining  the
              problem   to  be  printed.  With  ""predicate""  options  such  as
              ""--exists"" _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g runs silently  by  default,  because  it's
              usually used in scripts that want to control what's output. This
              option can be used  alone  (to  just  print  errors  encountered
              locating modules on the command line) or with other options. The
              PKG_CONFIG_DEBUG_SPEW  environment   variable   overrides   this
              option.

       _-_-_s_h_o_r_t_-_e_r_r_o_r_s
              Print short error messages.

       _-_-_s_i_l_e_n_c_e_-_e_r_r_o_r_s
              If  one  or  more  of  the modules on the command line, or their
              dependencies, are not found, or if an error occurs in parsing  a
              a  _._p_c  file,  then  this option will keep errors explaining the
              problem from being printed. With  ""predicate""  options  such  as
              ""--exists""  _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g  runs  silently  by default, because it's
              usually used in scripts that want to control what's  output.  So
              this  option  is  only useful with options such as ""--cflags"" or
              ""--modversion""  that  print  errors  by  default.  The  PKG_CON-
              FIG_DEBUG_SPEW environment variable overrides this option.

       _-_-_e_r_r_o_r_s_-_t_o_-_s_t_d_o_u_t
              If printing errors, print them to stdout rather than the default
              stderr

       _-_-_d_e_b_u_g
              Print debugging information. This is slightly different than the
              PKG_CONFIG_DEBUG_SPEW  environment  variable,  which also enable
              ""--print-errors"".


       The following options are used to compile and link programs:

       _-_-_c_f_l_a_g_s
              This prints pre-processor and compile flags required to  compile
              the  packages on the command line, including flags for all their
              dependencies. Flags are ""compressed"" so that each identical flag
              appears  only  once.  _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g exits with a nonzero code if it
              can't find metadata for one or more of the packages on the  com-
              mand line.

       _-_-_c_f_l_a_g_s_-_o_n_l_y_-_I
              This  prints  the -I part of ""--cflags"". That is, it defines the
              header search path but doesn't specify anything else.

       _-_-_c_f_l_a_g_s_-_o_n_l_y_-_o_t_h_e_r
              This prints parts of ""--cflags"" not covered  by  ""--cflags-only-
              I"".

       _-_-_l_i_b_s This  option is identical to ""--cflags"", only it prints the link
              flags. As with ""--cflags"", duplicate flags are merged (maintain-
              ing proper ordering), and flags for dependencies are included in
              the output.

       _-_-_l_i_b_s_-_o_n_l_y_-_L
              This prints the -L/-R part of ""--libs"". That is, it defines  the
              library  search path but doesn't specify which libraries to link
              with.

       _-_-_l_i_b_s_-_o_n_l_y_-_l
              This prints the -l part of ""--libs"" for the libraries  specified
              on  the command line. Note that the union of ""--libs-only-l"" and
              ""--libs-only-L"" may be smaller than ""--libs"", due to flags  such
              as -rdynamic.

       _-_-_l_i_b_s_-_o_n_l_y_-_o_t_h_e_r
              This prints the parts of ""--libs"" not covered by ""--libs-only-L""
              and ""--libs-only-l"", such as ""--pthread"".

       _-_-_v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_=_V_A_R_I_A_B_L_E_N_A_M_E
              This returns the value of a variable defined in a package's  _._p_c
              file.  Most  packages define the variable ""prefix"", for example,
              so you can say:
                $ pkg-config --variable=prefix glib-2.0
                /usr/

       _-_-_d_e_f_i_n_e_-_v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_=_V_A_R_I_A_B_L_E_N_A_M_E_=_V_A_R_I_A_B_L_E_V_A_L_U_E
              This sets a global value for a variable, overriding the value in
              any  _._p_c  files. Most packages define the variable ""prefix"", for
              example, so you can say:
                $ pkg-config --print-errors --define-variable=prefix=/foo \
                             --variable=prefix glib-2.0
                /foo

       _-_-_p_r_i_n_t_-_v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s
              Returns a list of all variables defined in the package.


       _-_-_u_n_i_n_s_t_a_l_l_e_d
              Normally if you request the package ""foo"" and the package  ""foo-
              uninstalled""  exists,  _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g will prefer the ""-uninstalled""
              variant. This  allows  compilation/linking  against  uninstalled
              packages.  If you specify the ""--uninstalled"" option, _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g
              will return successfully  if  any  ""-uninstalled""  packages  are
              being used, and return failure (false) otherwise.  (The PKG_CON-
              FIG_DISABLE_UNINSTALLED environment  variable  keeps  _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g
              from  implicitly  choosing  ""-uninstalled""  packages, so if that
              variable is set, they will only have been used  if  you  pass  a
              name like ""foo-uninstalled"" on the command line explicitly.)

       _-_-_e_x_i_s_t_s

       _-_-_a_t_l_e_a_s_t_-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n_=_V_E_R_S_I_O_N

       _-_-_e_x_a_c_t_-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n_=_V_E_R_S_I_O_N

       _-_-_m_a_x_-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n_=_V_E_R_S_I_O_N
              These  options  test  whether the package or list of packages on
              the command line are known to _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g, and optionally whether
              the  version  number of a package meets certain constraints.  If
              all packages exist and meet the specified  version  constraints,
              _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g  exits  successfully.  Otherwise  it exits unsuccess-
              fully. Only the first VERSION comparing option will be  honored.
              Subsequent options of this type will be ignored.

              Rather  than using the version-test options, you can simply give
              a version constraint after each package name, for example:
                $ pkg-config --exists 'glib-2.0 >= 1.3.4 libxml = 1.8.3'
              Remember to use --print-errors if you want error messages.  When
              no  output  options  are  supplied  to  _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g,  --exists is
              implied.

       _-_-_v_a_l_i_d_a_t_e
              Checks the syntax of a package's _._p_c file for validity. This  is
              the  same as --exists except that dependencies are not verified.
              This can be useful for package developers to test their _._p_c file
              prior to release:
                $ pkg-config --validate ./my-package.pc

       _-_-_m_s_v_c_-_s_y_n_t_a_x
              This  option  is available only on Windows. It causes _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g
              to output -l  and  -L  flags  in  the  form  recognized  by  the
              Microsoft  Visual  C++  command-line compiler, _c_l. Specifically,
              instead of _-_L_x_:_/_s_o_m_e_/_p_a_t_h it  prints  _/_l_i_b_p_a_t_h_:_x_/_s_o_m_e_/_p_a_t_h,  and
              instead  of _-_l_f_o_o it prints _f_o_o_._l_i_b. Note that the --libs output
              consists of flags for the linker, and should be placed on the cl
              command line after a /link switch.

       _-_-_d_e_f_i_n_e_-_p_r_e_f_i_x
              _-_-_d_o_n_t_-_d_e_f_i_n_e_-_p_r_e_f_i_x  These  options  control whether _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g
              overrides the value of the variable _p_r_e_f_i_x  in  each  .pc  file.
              With  --define-prefix, _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g uses the installed location of
              the .pc file to determine the prefix. --dont-define-prefix  pre-
              vents this behavior. The default is usually --define-prefix.

              When this feature is enabled and a .pc file is found in a direc-
              tory named _p_k_g_c_o_n_f_i_g, the prefix for that package is assumed  to
              be  the  grandparent  of the directory where the file was found,
              and the _p_r_e_f_i_x variable is overridden for that file accordingly.

              If  the value of a variable in a .pc file begins with the origi-
              nal, non-overridden, value of  the  _p_r_e_f_i_x  variable,  then  the
              overridden value of _p_r_e_f_i_x is used instead. This allows the fea-
              ture to work even when the variables have been expanded  in  the
              .pc file.

       _-_-_p_r_e_f_i_x_-_v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_=_P_R_E_F_I_X
              Set  the  name of the variable that _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g overrides instead
              of _p_r_e_f_i_x when using the --define-prefix feature.

       _-_-_s_t_a_t_i_c
              Output  libraries  suitable  for  static  linking.   That  means
              including  any  private libraries in the output.  This relies on
              proper tagging in the .pc files, else  a  too  large  number  of
              libraries will ordinarily be output.

       _-_-_l_i_s_t_-_a_l_l
              List all modules found in the _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g path.

       _-_-_p_r_i_n_t_-_p_r_o_v_i_d_e_s
              List all modules the given packages provides.

       _-_-_p_r_i_n_t_-_r_e_q_u_i_r_e_s
              List all modules the given packages requires.

       _-_-_p_r_i_n_t_-_r_e_q_u_i_r_e_s_-_p_r_i_v_a_t_e

       _P_K_G___C_O_N_F_I_G___P_A_T_H
              A colon-separated  (on  Windows,  semicolon-separated)  list  of
              directories to search for .pc files.  The default directory will
              always be searched after searching  the  path;  the  default  is
              _l_i_b_d_i_r_/pkgconfig:_d_a_t_a_d_i_r/pkgconfig  where  _l_i_b_d_i_r  is the libdir
              for _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g and _d_a_t_a_d_i_r is the datadir for _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g when it
              was installed.

              A value to set for the magic variable _p_c___t_o_p___b_u_i_l_d_d_i_r which  may
              appear in _._p_c files. If the environment variable is not set, the
              default value '$(top_builddir)'  will  be  used.  This  variable
              should  refer to the top builddir of the Makefile where the com-
              pile/link flags reported by _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g will be used.  This  only
              matters when compiling/linking against a package that hasn't yet
              been installed.

              variant. This  allows  compilation/linking  against  uninstalled
              packages.  If this environment variable is set, it disables said
              behavior.

              variables  used  by  many  compilers to affect the header search
              path. These are ignored on Windows builds when --msvc-syntax  is
              in use.

       _I_N_C_L_U_D_E

              A  path  variable  containing system directories searched by the
              linker.  This is normally _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b_:_/_l_i_b but is dependent on  the
              _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g  build  and  can  contain  other  directories such as

              Modify  -I  and -L to use the directories located in target sys-
              root.  this option is useful when cross-compiling packages  that
              use  pkg-config  to  determine CFLAGS and LDFLAGS. -I and -L are
              modified to point to the new system  root.  this  means  that  a
              -I/usr/include/libfoo will become -I/var/target/usr/include/lib-
              foo with a PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR  equal  to  /var/target  (same

              variable upper cased with non-alphanumeric characters  converted
              to underscores. For example, setting PKG_CONFIG_GLADEUI_2_0_CAT-

       _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g  sets a few metadata variables that can be used in .pc files
       or queried at runtime.

       _p_c___p_a_t_h
              The default search path used by _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g  when  searching  for
              .pc files. This can be used in a query for the _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g module
              itself itself:
                $ pkg-config --variable pc_path pkg-config

       _p_c_f_i_l_e_d_i_r
              The installed location of the .pc file.  This  can  be  used  to
              query  the location of the .pc file for a particular module, but
              it can also be used to make .pc files relocatable. For instance:
              prefix=${pcfiledir}/../..
              exec_prefix=${prefix}
              libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib

       _p_c___s_y_s_r_o_o_t_d_i_r
              The  sysroot  directory set by the user. When the sysroot direc-
              tory has not been set, this value is _/.  See the _P_K_G___C_O_N_F_I_G___S_Y_S_-

       The _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g default search path is ignored on Windows. Instead,  the
       search path is constructed by using the installed directory of _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_-
       _f_i_g and then appending _l_i_b_\_p_k_g_c_o_n_f_i_g and _s_h_a_r_e_\_p_k_g_c_o_n_f_i_g.  This can  be

              The macro PKG_CHECK_MODULES can be used in _c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e_._a_c to check
              whether modules exist. A typical usage would be:
               PKG_CHECK_MODULES([MYSTUFF], [gtk+-2.0 >= 1.3.5 libxml = 1.8.4])

              This  would  result in MYSTUFF_LIBS and MYSTUFF_CFLAGS substitu-
              tion variables, set to the libs and cflags for the given  module
              list.   If  a  module  is  missing  or has the wrong version, by
              default configure will abort with  a  message.  To  replace  the
              default      action,     specify     an     ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND.
              PKG_CHECK_MODULES will not print any error messages if you spec-
              ify  your  own  ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND.   However,  it will set the
              variable MYSTUFF_PKG_ERRORS, which you can use to  display  what
              went wrong.

              Note   that  if  there  is  a  possibility  the  first  call  to
              PKG_CHECK_MODULES might  not  happen,  you  should  be  sure  to
              include  an explicit call to PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG in your config-
              ure.ac.

              Also note that repeated usage of VARIABLE-PREFIX is  not  recom-
              mended.  After the first successful usage, subsequent calls with
              the same VARIABLE-PREFIX will simply use the _LIBS  and  _CFLAGS
              variables set from the previous usage without calling _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g
              again.

              Checks that the version of the pkg-config autoconf macros in use
              is at least MIN-VERSION. This can be used to ensure a particular
              pkg-config macro will be available.

       _P_K_G___P_R_O_G___P_K_G___C_O_N_F_I_G_(_[_M_I_N_-_V_E_R_S_I_O_N_]_)

              Defines the PKG_CONFIG variable to the  best  pkg-config  avail-
              able,  useful  if  you  need  pkg-config  but  don't want to use
              PKG_CHECK_MODULES.

              If the first call to PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG is conditional, then it
              will  not  work  correctly in all cases. Since many of the other
              macros such as PKG_CHECK_MODULES require PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG  to
              know which pkg-config program to run, PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG may be
              run for the first time from a  conditional  from  one  of  these
              macros.  Therefore, if any of the pkg-config macros will be used
              under a conditional, it's best to run PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG before
              any of the other macros are used.

       You would normally generate the file using configure, so that the  pre-
       fix, etc. are set to the proper values.  The GNU Autoconf manual recom-
       mends generating files like .pc files at build time rather than config-
       ure time, so when you build the .pc file is a matter of taste and pref-
       erence.

       Files have two kinds of line: keyword lines start with a keyword plus a
       colon,  and variable definitions start with an alphanumeric string plus
       an equals sign. Keywords are defined in advance and have special  mean-
       ing  to  _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g;  variables do not, you can have any variables that
       you wish (however, users may expect to  retrieve  the  usual  directory
       name variables).

       Note that variable references are written ""${foo}""; you can escape lit-
       eral ""${"" as ""$${"".

       _N_a_m_e_:  This field should be a human-readable name for the package. Note
              that it is not the name passed as an argument to _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g.

       _D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n_:
              This should be a brief description of the package

       _U_R_L_:   An  URL where people can get more information about and download
              the package

       _V_e_r_s_i_o_n_:
              This  should  be  the  most-specific-possible  package   version
              string.

       _R_e_q_u_i_r_e_s_:
              This  is a comma-separated list of packages that are required by
              your package. Flags from dependent packages will be merged in to
              the flags reported for your package. Optionally, you can specify
              the version of the required package (using the operators  =,  <,
              >,  >=,  <=);  specifying a version allows _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g to perform
              extra sanity checks. You may only mention the same  package  one
              time  on  the  _R_e_q_u_i_r_e_s_:  line.  If  the version of a package is
              unspecified, any version will be used with no checking.

       _R_e_q_u_i_r_e_s_._p_r_i_v_a_t_e_:
              A list of packages required by this package. The difference from
              _R_e_q_u_i_r_e_s  is that the packages listed under _R_e_q_u_i_r_e_s_._p_r_i_v_a_t_e are
              not taken into account when a flag list is computed for  dynami-
              cally linked executable (i.e., when --static was not specified).
              In the situation where each .pc file corresponds to  a  library,
              _R_e_q_u_i_r_e_s_._p_r_i_v_a_t_e shall be used exclusively to specify the depen-
              dencies between the libraries.

       _C_o_n_f_l_i_c_t_s_:
              This optional line allows _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g to perform additional  san-
              ity  checks, primarily to detect broken user installations.  The
              syntax is the same as _R_e_q_u_i_r_e_s_: except that  you  can  list  the
              same  package  more than once here, for example ""foobar = 1.2.3,
              foobar = 1.2.5, foobar >= 1.3"", if you have reason to do so.  If
              a  version isn't specified, then your package conflicts with all
              versions of the mentioned package.  If a user tries to use  your
              package  and  a  conflicting package at the same time, then _p_k_g_-
              _c_o_n_f_i_g will complain.

       _L_i_b_s_:  This line should give the link flags specific to  your  package.
              Don't  add  any flags for required packages; _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g will add
              those automatically.

       _L_i_b_s_._p_r_i_v_a_t_e_:
              This line should list any private  libraries  in  use.   Private
              libraries  are  libraries  which  are  not  exposed through your
              library, but are needed in the case of static linking. This dif-
              fers  from _R_e_q_u_i_r_e_s_._p_r_i_v_a_t_e in that it references libraries that
              do not have package files installed.

       _C_f_l_a_g_s_:
              This line should list the compile flags specific to  your  pack-
              age.  Don't add any flags for required packages; _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g will
              add those automatically.

       _p_k_g_-_c_o_n_f_i_g was written by James Henstridge, rewritten  by  Martijn  van
       Beers, and rewritten again by Havoc Pennington. Tim Janik, Owen Taylor,
       and Raja Harinath submitted suggestions and  some  code.   _g_n_o_m_e_-_c_o_n_f_i_g
       was  written  by  Miguel de Icaza, Raja Harinath and various hackers in
       the GNOME team.  It was inspired by Owen Taylor's _g_t_k_-_c_o_n_f_i_g program.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  _a_s  command  translates assembly code in the named files to object
       code.  If no files are specified, _a_s reads from ssttddiinn.   All  undefined
       symbols  in  the  assembly  are  treated  as global.  The output of the
       assembly is left in the file aa..oouutt by default.

       The program //uussrr//bbiinn//aass is actually a driver that  executes  assemblers
       for specific target architectures.  If no target architecture is speci-
       fied, it defaults to the architecture of the host it is running on.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --oo _n_a_m_e
              Name the output file _n_a_m_e instead of aa..oouutt.

       --aarrcchh _a_r_c_h___t_y_p_e
              Specifies the target architecture, _a_r_c_h___t_y_p_e, of  the  assembler
              to be executed.  The target assemblers for each architecture are
              in            //uussrr//lliibbeexxeecc//ggcccc//ddaarrwwiinn//_a_r_c_h___t_y_p_e//aass            or

              assembler for an architecture family.  If the  specified  target
              architecture is a machine-specific implementation, the assembler
              for   that    architecture    family    is    executed    (e.g.,
              //uussrr//lliibbeexxeecc//ggcccc//ddaarrwwiinn//ppppcc//aass  for --aarrcchh ppppcc660044ee).  See _a_r_c_h(3)
              for the currently known _a_r_c_h___t_y_p_es.

       --aarrcchh__mmuullttiippllee
              Precede any displayed messages with a line stating  the  program
              name  (aass) and the architecture (from the --aarrcchh _a_r_c_h___t_y_p_e flag),
              to distinguish which architecture the error messages  refer  to.
              When  the _c_c(1) driver program is run with multiple --aarrcchh flags,
              it invokes _a_s with the --aarrcchh__mmuullttiippllee option.

       --ffoorrccee__ccppuussuubbttyyppee__AALLLL
              By default, the assembler will produce the CPU subtype  ALL  for
              the  object file it is assembling if it finds no implementation-
              specific instructions.  Also  by  default,  the  assembler  will
              allow  implementation-specific instructions and will combine the
              CPU subtype for those specific implementations.   The  combining
              of  specific  implementations is architecture-dependent; if some
              combination of instructions is not allowed, an error  is  gener-
              ated.    With   the  optional  --ffoorrccee__ccppuussuubbttyyppee__AALLLL  flag,  all
              instructions are allowed and the object file's CPU subtype  will
              be  the  ALL subtype.  If the target architecture specified is a
              machine-specific  implementation  (e.g.,  --aarrcchh  ppppcc660033,   --aarrcchh
              ii448866),  the  assembler will flag as errors instructions that are
              not supported on that  architecture,  and  it  will  produce  an
              object  file  with the CPU subtype for that specific implementa-
              tion (even if no implementation-specific instructions are used).
              The  --ffoorrccee__ccppuussuubbttyyppee__AALLLL  flag  is the default for all x86 and
              x86_64 architectures.

       --ddyynnaammiicc
              Enables dynamic linking features.  This is the default.

       --ssttaattiicc
              Causes the assembler to treat  as  an  error  any  features  for
              dynamic linking.  Also causes the .text directive to not include
              the pure_instructions section attribute.

       ----     Use ssttddiinn for the assembly source input.

       --nn     Instructs the assembler not to assume  that  the  assembly  file
              starts  with  a ..tteexxtt directive.  Use this option when an output
              file is not to contain a (__TEXT,__text) section or this section
              is not to be first one in the output file.

       --ff     Fast;  no  need  for  the assembler preprocessor (``app'').  The
              assembler preprocessor can also be turned off  by  starting  the
              assembly  file  with  ""#NO_APP\n"".   This is intended for use by
              compilers which produce assembly code in a strict ""clean"" format
              that  specifies  exactly where whitespace can go.  The assembler
              preprocessor needs to be  run  on  hand-written  assembly  files
              and/or  files  that have been preprocessed by the C preprocessor
              ccpppp..  This is typically needed when assembler files  are  assem-
              bled  through  the use of the _c_c(1) command, which automatically
              runs the C preprocessor on assembly source files.  The assembler
              preprocessor strips out excess spaces, turns single-quoted char-
              acters into a decimal constants, and turns # <number> <filename>
              <level>  into  .line <number>;.file <filename>  pairs.  When the
              assembler preprocessor has been turned off by a  ""#NO_APP\n""  at
              the start of a file, it can be turned back on and off again with
              pairs of ""#APP\n"" and ""#NO_APP\n"" at the  beginnings  of  lines.
              This  is  used  by the compiler to wrap assembly statements pro-
              duced from aassmm(()) statements.

       --gg     Produce debugging information for the symbolic  debugger  _g_d_b(1)
              so  that  the assembly source can be debugged symbolically.  The
              debugger depends on correct use of the C preprocessor's #include
              directive  or  the  assembler's .include directive:  Any include
              file that produces instructions in the  (__TEXT,__text)  section
              must be included while a .text directive is in effect.  In other
              words, there must be a .text directive before the  include,  and
              the  .text  directive  must still be in effect at the end of the
              include file.  Otherwise, the debugger will get confused when in
              that assembly file.

       --vv     Display  the version of the assembler (both the Mac OS X version
              and the GNU version it is based on).

       --VV     Print the path and the command line of the assembler the  assem-
              bler driver is using.

       --II_d_i_r  Add  the  directory _d_i_r to the list of directories to search for
              files included with the .include directive.  The  default  place
              to search is the current directory.

       --WW     Suppress warnings.

       --LL     Save  non-global  defined  labels  beginning  with an 'L'; these
              labels are normally discarded to save  space  in  the  resultant
              symbol table.  The compiler generates such temporary labels.

       --qq     Use  the  _c_l_a_n_g(1) integrated assembler instead of the GNU based
              system assembler.  This is the  default  for  the  x86  and  arm
              architectures.

       --QQ     Use the GNU based system assembler.

              Treat  a  single trailing '+' or '-' after a conditional PowerPC
              branch instruction as a static branch prediction that  sets  the
              Y-bit  in the opcode.  Pairs of trailing ""++"" or ""--"" always set
              the AT-bits. This is the default for Mac OS X.

              Treat a single trailing '+' or '-' after a  conditional  PowerPC
              branch  instruction  as a static branch prediction that sets the
              AT-bits in the opcode. Pairs of trailing ""++"" or ""--"" always set
              the  AT-bits  but  with  this option a warning is issued if this
              syntax is used.  With this flag the assembler behaves  like  the
              IBM tools.

       --nnoo__ppppcc660011
              Treat any PowerPC 601 instructions as an error.

     segments.  These System V IPC objects can be specified by their creation
     id or any associated key.

     The following options are used to specify which IPC objects will be
     removed.  Any number and combination of these options can be used:

     --MM _s_h_m_k_e_y
             Mark the shared memory segment associated with key sshhmmkkeeyy for
             removal.  This marked segment will be destroyed after the last
             detach.

     --mm _s_h_m_i_d
             Mark the shared memory segment associated with id sshhmmiidd for
             removal.  This marked segment will be destroyed after the last
             detach.

     --QQ _m_s_g_k_e_y
             Remove the message queue associated with key mmssggkkeeyy from the sys-
             tem.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The mmaalllloocc(), ccaalllloocc(), vvaalllloocc(), rreeaalllloocc(), and rreeaallllooccff() functions
     allocate memory.  The allocated memory is aligned such that it can be
     used for any data type, including AltiVec- and SSE-related types.  The
     ffrreeee() function frees allocations that were created via the preceding
     allocation functions.

     The mmaalllloocc() function allocates _s_i_z_e bytes of memory and returns a
     pointer to the allocated memory.

     The ccaalllloocc() function contiguously allocates enough space for _c_o_u_n_t
     objects that are _s_i_z_e bytes of memory each and returns a pointer to the
     allocated memory.  The allocated memory is filled with bytes of value
     zero.

     The vvaalllloocc() function allocates _s_i_z_e bytes of memory and returns a
     pointer to the allocated memory.  The allocated memory is aligned on a
     page boundary.

     The rreeaalllloocc() function tries to change the size of the allocation pointed
     to by _p_t_r to _s_i_z_e, and returns _p_t_r.  If there is not enough room to
     enlarge the memory allocation pointed to by _p_t_r, rreeaalllloocc() creates a new
     allocation, copies as much of the old data pointed to by _p_t_r as will fit
     to the new allocation, frees the old allocation, and returns a pointer to
     the allocated memory.  If _p_t_r is NULL, rreeaalllloocc() is identical to a call
     to mmaalllloocc() for _s_i_z_e bytes.  If _s_i_z_e is zero and _p_t_r is not NULL, a new,
     minimum sized object is allocated and the original object is freed.  When
     extending a region allocated with calloc(3), realloc(3) does not guaran-
     tee that the additional memory is also zero-filled.

     The rreeaallllooccff() function is identical to the rreeaalllloocc() function, except
     that it will free the passed pointer when the requested memory cannot be
     allocated.  This is a FreeBSD specific API designed to ease the problems
     with traditional coding styles for realloc causing memory leaks in
     libraries.

     The ffrreeee() function deallocates the memory allocation pointed to by _p_t_r.
     _I_f _p_t_r is a NULL pointer, no operation is performed.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
     If successful, ccaalllloocc(), mmaalllloocc(), rreeaalllloocc(), rreeaallllooccff(), and vvaalllloocc()
     functions return a pointer to allocated memory.  If there is an error,
     they return a NULL pointer and set _e_r_r_n_o to ENOMEM.

     For rreeaalllloocc(), the input pointer is still valid if reallocation failed.
     For rreeaallllooccff(), the input pointer will have been freed if reallocation
     failed.

     The ffrreeee() function does not return a value.

     A number of facilities are provided to aid in debugging allocation errors
     in applications.  These facilities are primarily controlled via environ-
     ment variables.  The recognized environment variables and their meanings
     are documented below.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     The following environment variables change the behavior of the alloca-
     tion-related functions.

     MallocDebugReport            If set, specifies where messages are writ-
                                  ten. Set to ""stderr"" to write messages to
                                  the standard error stream, ""none"" to discard
                                  all messages and ""crash"" to write messages
                                  to standard error only for a condition that
                                  is about to cause a crash. When not set,
                                  message are written to the standard error
                                  stream if it appears to be a terminal (that
                                  is, if isatty(STDERR_FILENO) returns a non-
                                  zero value) and are otherwise discarded.

     MallocGuardEdges             If set, add a guard page before and after
                                  each large block.

     MallocDoNotProtectPrelude    If set, do not add a guard page before large
                                  blocks, even if the MallocGuardEdges envi-
                                  ronment variable is set.

     MallocDoNotProtectPostlude   If set, do not add a guard page after large
                                  blocks, even if the MallocGuardEdges envi-
                                  ronment variable is set.

     MallocStackLogging           The default behavior if this is set is to
                                  record all allocation and deallocation
                                  events to an on-disk log, along with stacks,
                                  so that tools like leaks(1) and
                                  malloc_history(1) can be used.

                                  Set to ""vm"" to record only allocation of
                                  virtual memory regions allocated by system
                                  calls and mach traps, such as by mmap(1)

                                  Set to ""malloc"" to record only allocations
                                  via malloc(3) and related interfaces, not
                                  virtual memory regions.

                                  Set to ""lite"" to record current allocations
                                  only, not history.   These are recorded by
                                  in-memory data structures, instead of an on-
                                  disk log.

     MallocStackLoggingNoCompact  If set, record all stacks in a manner that
                                  is compatible with the mmaalllloocc__hhiissttoorryy pro-
                                  gram.

     MallocStackLoggingDirectory  If set, records stack logs to the directory
                                  specified instead of saving them to the
                                  default location (/tmp).

     MallocScribble               If set, fill memory that has been allocated
                                  with 0xaa bytes.  This increases the likeli-
                                  hood that a program making assumptions about
                                  the contents of freshly allocated memory
                                  will fail.  Also if set, fill memory that
                                  has been deallocated with 0x55 bytes.  This
                                  increases the likelihood that a program will
                                  fail due to accessing memory that is no
                                  longer allocated. Note that due to the way
                                  in which freed memory is managed internally,
                                  the 0x55 pattern may not appear in some
                                  parts of a deallocated memory block.

     MallocCheckHeapStart <s>     If set, specifies the number of allocations
                                  _<_s_> to wait before begining periodic heap
                                  checks every _<_n_> as specified by
                                  MallocCheckHeapEach.  If
                                  MallocCheckHeapStart is set but
                                  MallocCheckHeapEach is not specified, the
                                  default check repetition is 1000.

     MallocCheckHeapEach <n>      If set, run a consistency check on the heap
                                  every _<_n_> operations.  MallocCheckHeapEach
                                  is only meaningful if MallocCheckHeapStart
                                  is also set.

     MallocCheckHeapSleep <t>     Sets the number of seconds to sleep (waiting
                                  for a debugger to attach) when
                                  MallocCheckHeapStart is set and a heap cor-
                                  ruption is detected.  The default is 100
                                  seconds.  Setting this to zero means not to
                                  sleep at all.  Setting this to a negative
                                  number means to sleep (for the positive num-
                                  ber of seconds) only the very first time a
                                  heap corruption is detected.

     MallocCheckHeapAbort <b>     When MallocCheckHeapStart is set and this is
                                  set to a non-zero value, causes abort(3) to
                                  be called if a heap corruption is detected,
                                  instead of any sleeping.

     MallocErrorAbort             If set, causes abort(3) to be called if an
                                  error was encountered in malloc(3) or
                                  free(3) , such as a calling free(3) on a
                                  pointer previously freed.

     MallocCorruptionAbort        Similar to MallocErrorAbort but will not
                                  abort in out of memory conditions, making it
                                  more useful to catch only those errors which
                                  will cause memory corruption.  MallocCorrup-
                                  tionAbort is always set on 64-bit processes.

     MallocHelp                   If set, print a list of environment vari-
                                  ables that are paid heed to by the alloca-
                                  tion-related functions, along with short
                                  descriptions.  The list should correspond to
                                  this documentation.

       mmaann formats and displays the on-line manual pages.  If you specify _s_e_c_-
       _t_i_o_n, mmaann only looks in that section of the manual.  _n_a_m_e  is  normally
       the  name of the manual page, which is typically the name of a command,
       function, or file.  However, if _n_a_m_e contains  a  slash  (//)  then  mmaann
       interprets  it  as a file specification, so that you can do mmaann ..//ffoooo..55
       or even mmaann //ccdd//ffoooo//bbaarr..11..ggzz.

       See below for a description of where mmaann  looks  for  the  manual  page
       files.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --CC  ccoonnffiigg__ffiillee
              Specify  the  configuration  file  to  use; the default is //pprrii--
              vvaattee//eettcc//mmaann..ccoonnff.  (See mmaann..ccoonnff(5).)

       --MM  ppaatthh
              Specify the list of directories to search for man pages.   Sepa-
              rate  the directories with colons.  An empty list is the same as
              not specifying --MM at all.  See SSEEAARRCCHH PPAATTHH FFOORR MMAANNUUAALL PPAAGGEESS.

       --PP  ppaaggeerr
              Specify which pager to use.  This option overrides the  MMAANNPPAAGGEERR
              environment  variable,  which  in turn overrides the PPAAGGEERR vari-
              able.  By default, mmaann uses //uussrr//bbiinn//lleessss --iiss.

       --BB     Specify which browser to use on HTML files.  This  option  over-
              rides  the  BBRROOWWSSEERR  environment  variable. By default, mmaann uses
              //uussrr//bbiinn//lleessss-is,,

       --HH     Specify a command that renders HTML files as text.  This  option
              overrides  the  HHTTMMLLPPAAGGEERR  environment variable. By default, mmaann
              uses //bbiinn//ccaatt,

       --SS  sseeccttiioonn__lliisstt
              List is a colon separated list of  manual  sections  to  search.
              This option overrides the MMAANNSSEECCTT environment variable.

       --aa     By default, mmaann will exit after displaying the first manual page
              it finds.  Using this option forces mmaann to display all the  man-
              ual pages that match nnaammee,, not just the first.

       --cc     Reformat  the  source man page, even when an up-to-date cat page
              exists.  This can be meaningful if the cat  page  was  formatted
              for  a screen with a different number of columns, or if the pre-
              formatted page is corrupted.

       --dd     Don't actually display the man  pages,  but  do  print  gobs  of
              debugging information.

       --DD     Both display and print debugging info.

       --ff     Equivalent to wwhhaattiiss.

       --FF or ----pprreeffoorrmmaatt
              Format only - do not display.

       --hh     Print a help message and exit.

       --kk     Equivalent to aapprrooppooss.

       --KK     Search  for  the  specified  string in *all* man pages. Warning:
              this is probably very slow!  It  helps  to  specify  a  section.
              (Just  to  give  a  rough idea, on my machine this takes about a
              minute per 500 man pages.)

       --mm  ssyysstteemm
              Specify an alternate set of man pages to  search  based  on  the
              system name given.

       --pp  ssttrriinngg
              Specify  the  sequence  of  preprocessors to run before nnrrooffff or
              ttrrooffff.  Not all installations will have a full set of preproces-
              sors.   Some of the preprocessors and the letters used to desig-
              nate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind  (v),
              refer  (r).   This  option  overrides the MMAANNRROOFFFFSSEEQQ environment
              variable.

       --tt     Use //uussrr//bbiinn//ggrrooffff --TTppss --mmaannddoocc --cc to format  the  manual  page,
              passing  the  output  to  ssttddoouutt..   The default output format of
              //uussrr//bbiinn//ggrrooffff --TTppss --mmaannddoocc --cc is Postscript, refer to the  man-
              ual  page  of //uussrr//bbiinn//ggrrooffff --TTppss --mmaannddoocc --cc for ways to pick an
              alternate format.

       Depending on the selected  format  and  the  availability  of  printing
       devices,  the  output  may  need  to  be  passed through some filter or
       another before being printed.

       --ww or ----ppaatthh
              Don't actually display the man pages, but  do  print  the  loca-
              tion(s) of the files that would be formatted or displayed. If no
              argument is given: display (on stdout) the list  of  directories
              that  is  searched by mmaann for man pages. If mmaannppaatthh is a link to
              man, then ""manpath"" is equivalent to ""man --path"".

       --WW     Like -w, but print file names one per line,  without  additional
              information.   This is useful in shell commands like mmaann --aaWW mmaann
              || xxaarrggss llss --ll


CCAATT PPAAGGEESS
       Man will try to save the formatted man pages, in order to save  format-
       ting time the next time these pages are needed.  Traditionally, format-
       ted versions of pages in DIR/manX are saved in DIR/catX, but other map-
       pings   from   man   dir   to   cat  dir  can  be  specified  in  //pprrii--
       vvaattee//eettcc//mmaann..ccoonnff.  No cat pages are saved when the required cat direc-
       tory  does  not  exist.  No cat pages are saved when they are formatted
       for a line length different from 80.   No  cat  pages  are  saved  when
       man.conf contains the line NOCACHE.

       It is possible to make mmaann suid to a user man. Then, if a cat directory
       has owner man and mode 0755 (only writable by man), and the  cat  files
       have  owner  man  and  mode  0644 or 0444 (only writable by man, or not
       writable at all), no ordinary user can change  the  cat  pages  or  put
       other  files  in the cat directory. If mmaann is not made suid, then a cat
       directory should have mode 0777 if all users should be  able  to  leave
       cat pages there.

       The  option  --cc  forces  reformatting a page, even if a recent cat page
       exists.


HHTTMMLL PPAAGGEESS
       Man will find HTML pages if they live in directories named as  expected
       to  be  "".html"", thus a valid name for an HTML version of the llss(1) man
       page would be _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_m_a_n_/_h_t_m_l_m_a_n_1_/_l_s_._1_._h_t_m_l.


SSEEAARRCCHH PPAATTHH FFOORR MMAANNUUAALL PPAAGGEESS
       mmaann uses a sophisticated method of finding manual page files, based  on
       the   invocation   options   and   environment   variables,  the  //pprrii--
       vvaattee//eettcc//mmaann..ccoonnff configuration file, and some built in conventions and
       heuristics.

       First  of  all, when the _n_a_m_e argument to mmaann contains a slash (//), mmaann
       assumes it is a file specification itself, and there  is  no  searching
       involved.

       But in the normal case where _n_a_m_e doesn't contain a slash, mmaann searches
       a variety of directories for a file that could be a manual page for the
       topic named.

       If  you  specify  the --MM _p_a_t_h_l_i_s_t option, _p_a_t_h_l_i_s_t is a colon-separated
       list of the directories that mmaann searches.

       If you don't specify --MM but set the MMAANNPPAATTHH environment  variable,  the
       value  of  that  variable  is  the  list  of  the  directories that mmaann
       searches.

       If you don't specify an explicit path list  with  --MM  or  MMAANNPPAATTHH,  mmaann
       develops  its  own path list based on the contents of the configuration
       file //pprriivvaattee//eettcc//mmaann..ccoonnff.  The MMAANNPPAATTHH statements in  the  configura-
       tion  file  identify  particular  directories  to include in the search
       path.

       Furthermore, the MMAANNPPAATTHH__MMAAPP statements add to the search path  depend-
       ing  on your command search path (i.e. your PPAATTHH environment variable).
       For each directory that may be in  the  command  search  path,  a  MMAANN--
       PPAATTHH__MMAAPP  statement  specifies  a directory that should be added to the
       search path for manual page files.  mmaann looks at the PPAATTHH variable  and
       adds the corresponding directories to the manual page file search path.
       Thus, with the proper use of MMAANNPPAATTHH__MMAAPP, when you  issue  the  command
       mmaann  xxyyzz,  you  get a manual page for the program that would run if you
       issued the command xxyyzz.

       In addition, for each directory in the command search path (we'll  call
       it  a  ""command  directory"")  for  which  you do _n_o_t have a MMAANNPPAATTHH__MMAAPP
       statement, mmaann automatically looks for a manual page directory ""nearby""
       namely as a subdirectory in the command directory itself or in the par-
       ent directory of the command directory.

       You can disable the automatic ""nearby"" searches by  including  a  NNOOAAUU--
       TTOOPPAATTHH statement in //pprriivvaattee//eettcc//mmaann..ccoonnff.

       In  each  directory in the search path as described above, mmaann searches
       for a file named _t_o_p_i_c.._s_e_c_t_i_o_n, with an optional suffix on the  section
       number  and  possibly  a compression suffix.  If it doesn't find such a
       file, it then looks in any subdirectories named mmaann_N or ccaatt_N where _N is
       the  manual section number.  If the file is in a ccaatt_N subdirectory, mmaann
       assumes it is a formatted manual page file (cat page).  Otherwise,  mmaann
       assumes it is unformatted.  In either case, if the filename has a known
       compression suffix (like ..ggzz), mmaann assumes it is gzipped.

       If you want to see where (or if) mmaann would find the manual page  for  a
       particular topic, use the ----ppaatthh (--ww) option.


EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       MMAANNPPAATTHH
              If  MMAANNPPAATTHH is set, mmaann uses it as the path to search for manual
              page files.  It overrides the configuration file and  the  auto-
              matic  search  path,  but  is  overridden  by  the --MM invocation
              option.  See SSEEAARRCCHH PPAATTHH FFOORR MMAANNUUAALL PPAAGGEESS.

       MMAANNPPLL  If MMAANNPPLL is set, its value is used as the display  page  length.
              Otherwise, the entire man page will occupy one (long) page.

       MMAANNRROOFFFFSSEEQQ
              If  MMAANNRROOFFFFSSEEQQ is set, its value is used to determine the set of
              preprocessors run before running nnrrooffff or  ttrrooffff.   By  default,
              pages are passed through the tbl preprocessor before nnrrooffff.

       MMAANNSSEECCTT
              If  MMAANNSSEECCTT  is set, its value is used to determine which manual
              sections to search.

       MMAANNWWIIDDTTHH
              If MMAANNWWIIDDTTHH is set, its value is  used  as  the  width  manpages
              should  be displayed.  Otherwise the pages may be displayed over
              the whole width of your screen.

       MMAANNPPAAGGEERR
              If MMAANNPPAAGGEERR is set, its value is used as the name of the program
              to  use to display the man page.  If not, then PPAAGGEERR is used. If
              that has no value either, //uussrr//bbiinn//lleessss --iiss is used.

       BBRROOWWSSEERR
              The name of a browser to use for displaying HTML  manual  pages.
              If it is not set, /usr/bin/less -is is used.

       HHTTMMLLPPAAGGEERR
              The  command to use for rendering HTML manual pages as text.  If
              it is not set, /bin/cat is used.

       LLAANNGG   If LLAANNGG is set, its value defines the name of  the  subdirectory
              where  man first looks for man pages. Thus, the command `LANG=dk
              man 1 foo' will cause man to  look  for  the  foo  man  page  in
              .../dk/man1/foo.1,  and  if  it cannot find such a file, then in
              .../man1/foo.1, where ... is a directory on the search path.

       NNLLSSPPAATTHH,, LLCC__MMEESSSSAAGGEESS,, LLAANNGG
              The environment variables NNLLSSPPAATTHH and LLCC__MMEESSSSAAGGEESS (or LLAANNGG  when
              the  latter  does not exist) play a role in locating the message
              catalog.  (But the English messages are  compiled  in,  and  for
              English no catalog is required.)  Note that programs like ccooll((11))
              called by man also use e.g. LC_CTYPE.

       PPAATTHH   PPAATTHH helps determine the search path for manual page files.  See
              SSEEAARRCCHH PPAATTHH FFOORR MMAANNUUAALL PPAAGGEESS.

       SSYYSSTTEEMM SSYYSSTTEEMM is used to get the default alternate system name (for use
              with the --mm option).

BBUUGGSS
       The --tt option only works if a troff-like program is installed.
       If you see blinking  \255  or  <AD>  instead  of  hyphens,  put  `LESS-
       CHARSET=latin1' in your environment.

TTIIPPSS
       If you add the line

         (global-set-key  [(f1)]  (lambda () (interactive) (manual-entry (cur-
       rent-word))))

       to your _._e_m_a_c_s file, then hitting F1 will give you the man page for the
       library call at the current cursor position.

       To  get  a  plain  text  version  of a man page, without backspaces and
       underscores, try

         # man foo | col -b > foo.mantxt

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     IIoossttaatt displays kernel I/O statistics on terminal, device and cpu opera-
     tions.  The first statistics that are printed are averaged over the sys-
     tem uptime.  To get information about the current activity, a suitable
     wait time should be specified, so that the subsequent sets of printed
     statistics will be averaged over that time.

     The options are as follows:

     --??    Display a usage statement and exit.

     --CC    Display CPU statistics.  This is on by default, unless --dd is speci-
           fied.

     --cc    Repeat the display _c_o_u_n_t times.  If no _w_a_i_t interval is specified,
           the default is 1 second.

     --dd    Display only device statistics.  If this flag is turned on, only
           device statistics will be displayed, unless --CC or --UU or --TT is also
           specfied to enable the display of CPU, load average or TTY statis-
           tics.

     --II    Display total statstics for a given time period, rather than aver-
           age statistics for each second during that time period.

     --KK    In the blocks transferred display (-o), display block count in
           kilobytes rather then the device native block size.

     --nn    Display up to _d_e_v_s number of devices.  iioossttaatt will display fewer
           devices if there aren't _d_e_v_s devices present.

     --oo    Display old-style iioossttaatt device statistics.  Sectors per second,
           transfers per second, and miliseconds per seek are displayed.  If
           --II is specified, total blocks/sectors, total transfers, and
           miliseconds per seek are displayed.

     --TT    Display TTY statistics.  This is on by default, unless --dd is speci-
           fied.

     --UU    Display system load averages.  This is on by default, unless --dd is
           specified.

     --ww    Pause _w_a_i_t seconds between each display.  If no repeat _c_o_u_n_t is
           specified, the default is infinity.

     IIoossttaatt displays its information in the following format:

     tty
           tin     characters read from terminals
           tout    characters written to terminals

     devices
           Device operations.  The header of the field is the device name and
           unit number.  iioossttaatt will display as many devices as will fit in a
           standard 80 column screen, or the maximum number of devices in the
           system, whichever is smaller.  If --nn is specified on the command
           line, iioossttaatt will display the smaller of the requested number of
           devices, and the maximum number of devices in the system.  To force
           iioossttaatt to display specific drives, their names may be supplied on
           the command line.  iioossttaatt will not display more devices than will
           fit in an 80 column screen, unless the --nn argument is given on the
           command line to specify a maximum number of devices to display, or
           the list of specified devices exceeds 80 columns.  If fewer devices
           are specified on the command line than will fit in an 80 column
           screen, iioossttaatt will show only the specified devices.

           The standard iioossttaatt device display shows the following statistics:

           KB/t    kilobytes per transfer
           tps     transfers per second
           MB/s    megabytes per second

           The standard iioossttaatt device display, with the --II flag specified,
           shows the following statistics:

           KB/t    kilobytes per transfer
           xfrs    total number of transfers
           MB      total number of megabytes transferred

           The old-style iioossttaatt display (using --oo) shows the following statis-
           tics:

           sps     sectors transferred per second
           tps     transfers per second
           msps    average milliseconds per transaction

           The old-style iioossttaatt display, with the --II flag specified, shows the

     The nneettssttaatt command symbolically displays the contents of various net-
     work-related data structures.  There are a number of output formats,
     depending on the options for the information presented.  The first form
     of the command displays a list of active sockets for each protocol.  The
     second form presents the contents of one of the other network data struc-
     tures according to the option selected. Using the third form, with a _w_a_i_t
     interval specified, nneettssttaatt will continuously display the information
     regarding packet traffic on the configured network interfaces.  The
     fourth form displays statistics for the specified protocol or address
     family. If a _w_a_i_t interval is specified, the protocol information over
     the last interval seconds will be displayed.  The fifth form displays
     per-interface statistics for the specified protocol or address family.
     The sixth form displays mbuf(9) statistics.  The seventh form displays
     routing table for the specified address family.  The eighth form displays
     routing statistics.

     The options have the following meaning:

     --AA    With the default display, show the address of any protocol control
           blocks associated with sockets and the flow hash; used for debug-
           ging.

     --aa    With the default display, show the state of all sockets; normally
           sockets used by server processes are not shown. With the routing
           table display (option --rr, as described below), show protocol-cloned
           routes (routes generated by a RTF_PRCLONING parent route); normally
           these routes are not shown.

     --bb    With the interface display (option --ii, as described below), show
           the number of bytes in and out.

     --cc _q_u_e_u_e
           With the queue statistics (option --qq, as described below), show
           only those for the specified _q_u_e_u_e.

     --dd    With either interface display (option --ii or an interval, as
           described below), show the number of dropped packets.

     --ff _a_d_d_r_e_s_s___f_a_m_i_l_y
           Limit statistics or address control block reports to those of the
           specified _a_d_d_r_e_s_s _f_a_m_i_l_y.  The following address families are rec-
           ognized: _i_n_e_t, for AF_INET, _i_n_e_t_6, for AF_INET6 and _u_n_i_x, for
           AF_UNIX.

     --gg    Show information related to multicast (group address) membership.
           If the --ss option is also present, show extended interface group
           management statistics.  If the --vv option is specified, show link-
           layer memberships; they are suppressed by default.  Source lists
           for each group will also be printed.  Specifiying --vv twice will
           print the control plane timers for each interface and the source
           list counters for each group.  If the --ii is specified, only that
           interface will be shown.  If the --ff is specified, only information
           for the address family will be displayed.

     --II _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e
           Show information about the specified interface; used with a _w_a_i_t
           interval as described below.  If the --ss option is present, show
           per-interface protocol statistics on the _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e for the speci-
           fied _a_d_d_r_e_s_s___f_a_m_i_l_y or _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l, or for all protocol families.

     --ii    Show the state of interfaces which have been auto-configured
           (interfaces statically configured into a system, but not located at
           boot time are not shown).  If the --aa options is also present, mul-
           ticast addresses currently in use are shown for each Ethernet
           interface and for each IP interface address.  Multicast addresses
           are shown on separate lines following the interface address with
           which they are associated.  If the --ss option is present, show per-
           interface statistics on all interfaces for the specified
           _a_d_d_r_e_s_s___f_a_m_i_l_y or _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l, or for all protocol families.

     --LL    Show the size of the various listen queues.  The first count shows
           the number of unaccepted connections.  The second count shows the
           amount of unaccepted incomplete connections.  The third count is
           the maximum number of queued connections.

     --ll    Print full IPv6 address.

     --mm    Show statistics recorded by the memory management routines (the
           network stack manages a private pool of memory buffers). More
           detailed information about the buffers, which includes their cache
           related statistics, can be obtained by using --mmmm or --mm --mm option.

     --nn    Show network addresses as numbers (normally nneettssttaatt interprets
           addresses and attempts to display them symbolically).  This option
           may be used with any of the display formats.

     --pp _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l
           Show statistics about _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l, which is either a well-known name
           for a protocol or an alias for it.  Some protocol names and aliases
           are listed in the file _/_e_t_c_/_p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s.  The special protocol name
           ``bdg'' is used to show bridging statistics.  A null response typi-
           cally means that there are no interesting numbers to report.  The
           program will complain if _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l is unknown or if there is no sta-
           tistics routine for it.

     --qq    Show network interface send queue statistics.  By default all
           queues are displayed, unless specified with --cc.  This option
           requires specifying an interface with --II option.  More detailed
           information about the queues, which includes their queueing algo-
           rithm related statistics, can be obtained by using --qqqq or --qq --qq
           option.

     --rr    Show the routing tables.  Use with --aa to show protocol-cloned
           routes.  When --ss is also present, show routing statistics instead.
           When --ll is also present, nneettssttaatt assumes more columns are there and
           the maximum transmission unit.  More detailed information about the
           route metrics are displayed with --llll for TCP round trip times --llllll
           for all metrics.  Use the --zz flags to display only entries with
           non-zero RTT values.  (``mtu'') are also displayed.

     --RR    Show reachability information.  Use with --ii to show link-layer
           reachability information for a given interface.

     --ss    Show per-protocol statistics.  If this option is repeated, counters
           with a value of zero are suppressed.  For security reasons, root
           privileges are required to read TCP statistics and in the absence
           of such privileges all TCP counters will be reported as zero.

     --SS    Show interface link status and interface state information about
           the specified interface.  This option requires specifying an inter-
           face with --II option.

     --vv    Increase verbosity level.

     --WW    In certain displays, avoid truncating addresses even if this causes
           some fields to overflow.

     --ww _w_a_i_t
           Show network interface or protocol statistics at intervals of _w_a_i_t
           seconds.

     --xx    Show extended link-layer reachability information in addition to
           that shown by the --RR flag.

OOUUTTPPUUTT
     The default display, for active sockets, shows the local and remote
     addresses, send and receive queue sizes (in bytes), protocol, and the
     internal state of the protocol.  Address formats are of the form
     ``host.port'' or ``network.port'' if a socket's address specifies a net-
     work but no specific host address.  If known, the host and network
     addresses are displayed symbolically according to the databases
     _/_e_t_c_/_h_o_s_t_s and _/_e_t_c_/_n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s, respectively.  If a symbolic name for an
     address is unknown, or if the --nn option is specified, the address is
     printed numerically, according to the address family.  For more informa-
     tion regarding the Internet ``dot format'', refer to inet(3)).  Unspeci-
     fied, or ``wildcard'', addresses and ports appear as ``*''.

     Internet domain socket states:

     CLOSED:  The socket is not in use.

     LISTEN:  The socket is listening for incoming connections.  Unconnected
     listening sockets like these are only displayed when using the -a option.

     SYN_SENT:  The socket is actively trying to establish a connection to a
     remote peer.

     SYN_RCVD:  The socket has passively received a connection request from a
     remote peer.

     ESTABLISHED:  The socket has an established connection between a local
     application and a remote peer.

     CLOSE_WAIT:  The socket connection has been closed by the remote peer,
     and the system is waiting for the local application to close its half of
     the connection.

     LAST_ACK:  The socket connection has been closed by the remote peer, the
     local application has closed its half of the connection, and the system
     is waiting for the remote peer to acknowledge the close.

     FIN_WAIT_1:  The socket connection has been closed by the local
     application, the remote peer has not yet acknowledged the close, and the
     system is waiting for it to close its half of the connection.

     FIN_WAIT_2:  The socket connection has been closed by the local
     application, the remote peer has acknowledged the close, and the system
     is waiting for it to close its half of the connection.

     CLOSING:  The socket connection has been closed by the local application
     and the remote peer simultaneously, and the remote peer has not yet
     acknowledged the close attempt of the local application.

     TIME_WAIT:  The socket connection has been closed by the local
     application, the remote peer has closed its half of the connection, and
     the system is waiting to be sure that the remote peer received the last
     acknowledgement.

     The interface display provides a table of cumulative statistics regarding
     packets transferred, errors, and collisions.  The network addresses of
     the interface and the maximum transmission unit (``mtu'') are also dis-
     played.

     The routing table display indicates the available routes and their sta-
     tus.  Each route consists of a destination host or network and a gateway
     to use in forwarding packets.  The flags field shows a collection of
     information about the route stored as binary choices.  The individual
     flags are discussed in more detail in the route(8) and route(4) manual
     pages.  The mapping between letters and flags is:

     1       RTF_PROTO1       Protocol specific routing flag #1
     2       RTF_PROTO2       Protocol specific routing flag #2
     3       RTF_PROTO3       Protocol specific routing flag #3
     B       RTF_BLACKHOLE    Just discard packets (during updates)
     b       RTF_BROADCAST    The route represents a broadcast address
     C       RTF_CLONING      Generate new routes on use
     c       RTF_PRCLONING    Protocol-specified generate new routes on use
     D       RTF_DYNAMIC      Created dynamically (by redirect)
     G       RTF_GATEWAY      Destination requires forwarding by intermediary
     H       RTF_HOST         Host entry (net otherwise)
     I       RTF_IFSCOPE      Route is associated with an interface scope
     i       RTF_IFREF        Route is holding a reference to the interface
     L       RTF_LLINFO       Valid protocol to link address translation
     M       RTF_MODIFIED     Modified dynamically (by redirect)
     m       RTF_MULTICAST    The route represents a multicast address
     R       RTF_REJECT       Host or net unreachable
     r       RTF_ROUTER       Host is a default router
     S       RTF_STATIC       Manually added
     U       RTF_UP           Route usable
     W       RTF_WASCLONED    Route was generated as a result of cloning
     X       RTF_XRESOLVE     External daemon translates proto to link address
     Y       RTF_PROXY        Proxying; cloned routes will not be scoped

     Direct routes are created for each interface attached to the local host;
     the gateway field for such entries shows the address of the outgoing
     interface.  The refcnt field gives the current number of active uses of
     the route.  Connection oriented protocols normally hold on to a single
     route for the duration of a connection while connectionless protocols
     obtain a route while sending to the same destination.  The use field pro-
     vides a count of the number of packets sent using that route.  The inter-
     face entry indicates the network interface utilized for the route.  A
     route which is marked with the RTF_IFSCOPE flag is instantiated for the
     corresponding interface.  A cloning route which is marked with the
     RTF_PROXY flag will not generate new routes that are associated with its
     interface scope.

     When nneettssttaatt is invoked with the --ww option and a _w_a_i_t interval argument,
     it displays a running count of statistics related to network interfaces
     or protocols.  An obsolete version of this option used a numeric parame-
     ter with no option, and is currently supported for backward compatibil-
     ity.  By default, this display summarizes information for all interfaces.
     Information for a specific interface may be displayed with the --II option.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

       Get meta information of a PHAR entry or a PHAR  package  in  serialized
       from. If no output file is specified for meta data then stdout is being
       used.  You can also specify a particular index using -k. In  that  case
       the  metadata  is  expected  to  be an array and the value of the given
       index is returned using echo rather than using serialize. If that index
       does not exist or no meta data is present then the return value is 1.

       Required arguments:

       --ff _f_i_l_e        Specifies the phar _f_i_l_e to work on.

       Set meta data of a PHAR entry or a PHAR package using serialized input.
       If  no  input file is specified for meta data then stdin is being used.
       You can also specify a particular index using  -k.  In  that  case  the
       metadata is expected to be an array and the value of the given index is
       being set.  If the metadata is not present or empty a new array will be
       created.   If  the metadata is present and a flat value then the return
       value is 1. Also using -k the input is been taken directly rather  then
       being serialized.

       Required arguments:

       --ff _f_i_l_e        Specifies the phar _f_i_l_e to work on.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This manual page documents version 5.04 of the ffiillee command.

     ffiillee tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  There are three
     sets of tests, performed in this order: filesystem tests, magic tests,
     and language tests.  The _f_i_r_s_t test that succeeds causes the file type to
     be printed.

     The type printed will usually contain one of the words _t_e_x_t (the file
     contains only printing characters and a few common control characters and
     is probably safe to read on an ASCII terminal), _e_x_e_c_u_t_a_b_l_e (the file con-
     tains the result of compiling a program in a form understandable to some
     UNIX kernel or another), or _d_a_t_a meaning anything else (data is usually
     ``binary'' or non-printable).  Exceptions are well-known file formats
     (core files, tar archives) that are known to contain binary data.  When
     modifying magic files or the program itself, make sure to _p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e _t_h_e_s_e
     _k_e_y_w_o_r_d_s.  Users depend on knowing that all the readable files in a
     directory have the word ``text'' printed.  Don't do as Berkeley did and
     change ``shell commands text'' to ``shell script''.

     The filesystem tests are based on examining the return from a stat(2)
     system call.  The program checks to see if the file is empty, or if it's
     some sort of special file.  Any known file types appropriate to the sys-
     tem you are running on (sockets, symbolic links, or named pipes (FIFOs)
     on those systems that implement them) are intuited if they are defined in
     the system header file <_s_y_s_/_s_t_a_t_._h>.

     The magic tests are used to check for files with data in particular fixed
     formats.  The canonical example of this is a binary executable (compiled
     program) a.out file, whose format is defined in <_e_l_f_._h>, <_a_._o_u_t_._h> and
     possibly <_e_x_e_c_._h> in the standard include directory.  These files have a
     ``magic number'' stored in a particular place near the beginning of the
     file that tells the UNIX operating system that the file is a binary exe-
     cutable, and which of several types thereof.  The concept of a ``magic''
     has been applied by extension to data files.  Any file with some invari-
     ant identifier at a small fixed offset into the file can usually be
     described in this way.  The information identifying these files is read
     from the compiled magic file _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_f_i_l_e_/_m_a_g_i_c_._m_g_c, or the files in
     the directory _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_f_i_l_e_/_m_a_g_i_c if the compiled file does not exist.

     If a file does not match any of the entries in the magic file, it is
     examined to see if it seems to be a text file.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non-
     ISO 8-bit extended-ASCII character sets (such as those used on Macintosh
     and IBM PC systems), UTF-8-encoded Unicode, UTF-16-encoded Unicode, and
     EBCDIC character sets can be distinguished by the different ranges and
     sequences of bytes that constitute printable text in each set.  If a file
     passes any of these tests, its character set is reported.  ASCII,
     ISO-8859-x, UTF-8, and extended-ASCII files are identified as ``text''
     because they will be mostly readable on nearly any terminal; UTF-16 and
     EBCDIC are only ``character data'' because, while they contain text, it
     is text that will require translation before it can be read.  In addi-
     tion, ffiillee will attempt to determine other characteristics of text-type
     files.  If the lines of a file are terminated by CR, CRLF, or NEL,
     instead of the Unix-standard LF, this will be reported.  Files that con-
     tain embedded escape sequences or overstriking will also be identified.

     Once ffiillee has determined the character set used in a text-type file, it
     will attempt to determine in what language the file is written.  The lan-
     guage tests look for particular strings (cf.  <_n_a_m_e_s_._h>) that can appear
     anywhere in the first few blocks of a file.  For example, the keyword _._b_r
     indicates that the file is most likely a troff(1) input file, just as the
     keyword _s_t_r_u_c_t indicates a C program.  These tests are less reliable than
     the previous two groups, so they are performed last.  The language test
     routines also test for some miscellany (such as tar(1) archives).

     Any file that cannot be identified as having been written in any of the
     character sets listed above is simply said to be ``data''.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS

             Causes the file command to output the file type and creator code
             as used by older MacOS versions. The code consists of eight let-
             ters, the first describing the file type, the latter the creator.

     --bb, ----bbrriieeff
             Do not prepend filenames to output lines (brief mode).

     --CC, ----ccoommppiillee
             Write a _m_a_g_i_c_._m_g_c output file that contains a pre-parsed version
             of the magic file or directory.

     --cc, ----cchheecckkiinngg--pprriinnttoouutt
             Cause a checking printout of the parsed form of the magic file.
             This is usually used in conjunction with the --mm flag to debug a
             new magic file before installing it.

     --CC, ----ccoommppiillee
             Write a _m_a_g_i_c_._m_g_c output file that contains a pre-parsed version
             of the magic file or directory.

     --dd      Apply the default system tests; this is the default behavior
             unless --MM is specified.

     --DD      Print debugging messages.

     --EE      On filesystem errors (file not found etc), instead of handling
             the error as regular output as POSIX mandates and keep going,
             issue an error message and exit.

     --ee, ----eexxcclluuddee _t_e_s_t_n_a_m_e
             Exclude the test named in _t_e_s_t_n_a_m_e from the list of tests made to
             determine the file type.  Valid test names are:

             apptype   EMX application type (only on EMX).

             ascii     Various types of text files (this test will try to
                       guess the text encoding, irrespective of the setting of
                       the `encoding' option).

             encoding  Different text encodings for soft magic tests.

             elf       Prints ELF file details, provided soft magic tests are
                       enabled and the elf magic is found.

             soft      Consults magic files.

             tar       Examines tar files.

     ----eexxtteennssiioonn
             Print a slash-separated list of valid extensions for the file
             type found.

     --FF, ----sseeppaarraattoorr _s_e_p_a_r_a_t_o_r
             Use the specified string as the separator between the filename
             and the file result returned.  Defaults to `:'.

     --ff, ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e
             Read the names of the files to be examined from _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e (one per
             line) before the argument list.  Either _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e or at least one
             filename argument must be present; to test the standard input,
             use `-' as a filename argument.  Please note that _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e is
             unwrapped and the enclosed filenames are processed when this
             option is encountered and before any further options processing
             is done.  This allows one to process multiple lists of files with
             different command line arguments on the same ffiillee invocation.
             Thus if you want to set the delimiter, you need to do it before
             you specify the list of files, like: ``--FF _@ --ff _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e'',
             instead of: ``--ff _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e --FF _@''.

     --hh, ----nnoo--ddeerreeffeerreennccee
             option causes symlinks not to be followed (on systems that sup-
             port symbolic links).

     --ii      If the file is a regular file, do not classify its contents.

     --II, ----mmiimmee
             Causes the file command to output mime type strings rather than
             the more traditional human readable ones.  Thus it may say

             Normally, ffiillee only attempts to read and determine the type of
             argument files which stat(2) reports are ordinary files.  This
             prevents problems, because reading special files may have pecu-
             liar consequences.  Specifying the --ss option causes ffiillee to also
             read argument files which are block or character special files.
             This is useful for determining the filesystem types of the data
             in raw disk partitions, which are block special files.  This
             option also causes ffiillee to disregard the file size as reported by
             stat(2) since on some systems it reports a zero size for raw disk
             partitions.

     This program conforms to Version 3 of the Single UNIX Specification
     (``SUSv3'').  Its behavior is mostly compatible with the System V program
     of the same name.  This version knows more magic, however, so it will
     produce different (albeit more accurate) output in many cases.

     The one significant difference between this version and System V is that
     this version treats any white space as a delimiter, so that spaces in
     pattern strings must be escaped.  For example,

           >10     string  language impress        (imPRESS data)

     in an existing magic file would have to be changed to

           >10     string  language\ impress       (imPRESS data)

     In addition, in this version, if a pattern string contains a backslash,
     it must be escaped.  For example

           0       string          \begindata      Andrew Toolkit document

     in an existing magic file would have to be changed to

           0       string          \\begindata     Andrew Toolkit document

     SunOS releases 3.2 and later from Sun Microsystems include a ffiillee command
     derived from the System V one, but with some extensions.  This version
     differs from Sun's only in minor ways.  It includes the extension of the
     `&' operator, used as, for example,

           >16     long&0x7fffffff >0              not stripped

     The magic file entries have been collected from various sources, mainly
     USENET, and contributed by various authors.  Christos Zoulas (address
     below) will collect additional or corrected magic file entries.  A con-
     solidation of magic file entries will be distributed periodically.

     The order of entries in the magic file is significant.  Depending on what
     system you are using, the order that they are put together may be incor-

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     There has been a ffiillee command in every UNIX since at least Research
     Version 4 (man page dated November, 1973).  The System V version intro-
     duced one significant major change: the external list of magic types.
     This slowed the program down slightly but made it a lot more flexible.

     This program, based on the System V version, was written by Ian Darwin
     <ian@darwinsys.com> without looking at anybody else's source code.

     John Gilmore revised the code extensively, making it better than the
     first version.  Geoff Collyer found several inadequacies and provided
     some magic file entries.  Contributions of the `&' operator by Rob McMa-
     hon, <cudcv@warwick.ac.uk>, 1989.

     Guy Harris, <guy@netapp.com>, made many changes from 1993 to the present.

     Primary development and maintenance from 1990 to the present by Christos
     Zoulas <christos@astron.com>.

     Altered by Chris Lowth <chris@lowth.com>, 2000: handle the --II option to
     output mime type strings, using an alternative magic file and internal
     logic.

     Altered by Eric Fischer <enf@pobox.com>, July, 2000, to identify charac-
     ter codes and attempt to identify the languages of non-ASCII files.

     Altered by Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>, 2007-2011, to improve MIME sup-
     port, merge MIME and non-MIME magic, support directories as well as files
     of magic, apply many bug fixes, update and fix a lot of magic, improve
     the build system, improve the documentation, and rewrite the Python bind-
     ings in pure Python.

     The list of contributors to the `magic' directory (magic files) is too
     long to include here.  You know who you are; thank you.  Many contribu-
     tors are listed in the source files.

     Fix output so that tests for MIME and APPLE flags are not needed all over
     the place, and actual output is only done in one place.  This needs a
     design.  Suggestion: push possible outputs on to a list, then pick the
     last-pushed (most specific, one hopes) value at the end, or use a default
     if the list is empty.  This should not slow down evaluation.

     The handling of MAGIC_CONTINUE and printing \012- between entries is
     clumsy and complicated; refactor and centralize.

     Some of the encoding logic is hard-coded in encoding.c and can be moved
     to the magic files if we had a !:charset annotation

     Continue to squash all magic bugs.  See Debian BTS for a good source.

     Store arbitrarily long strings, for example for %s patterns, so that they
     can be printed out.  Fixes Debian bug #271672.  This can be done by allo-
     cating strings in a string pool, storing the string pool at the end of
     the magic file and converting all the string pointers to relative offsets
     from the string pool.

     Add syntax for relative offsets after current level (Debian bug #466037).

     Make file -ki work, i.e. give multiple MIME types.

     Add a zip library so we can peek inside Office2007 documents to print
     more details about their contents.

     Add an option to print URLs for the sources of the file descriptions.

     Combine script searches and add a way to map executable names to MIME
     types (e.g. have a magic value for !:mime which causes the resulting
     string to be looked up in a table).  This would avoid adding the same
     magic repeatedly for each new hash-bang interpreter.

     When a file descriptor is available, we can skip and adjust the buffer
     instead of the hacky buffer management we do now.

     Fix ``name'' and ``use'' to check for consistency at compile time (dupli-
     cate ``name'', ``use'' pointing to undefined ``name'' ).  Make ``name'' /
     ``use'' more efficient by keeping a sorted list of names.  Special-case ^
     to flip endianness in the parser so that it does not have to be escaped,
     and document it.

     If the offsets specified internally in the file exceed the buffer size (
     HOWMANY variable in file.h), then we don't seek to that offset, but we
     give up.  It would be better if buffer managements was done when the file
     descriptor is available so move around the file.  One must be careful
     though because this has performance (and thus security considerations).

     logins in the file llaassttlloogg.  The time stamps of date changes, shutdowns
     and reboots are also logged in the wwttmmpp file.

     These files can grow rapidly on busy systems, daily or weekly rotation is
     recommended.  If any of these files do not exist, it is not created.
     These files must be created manually and are normally maintained in
     either the script _/_e_t_c_/_d_a_i_l_y or the script _/_e_t_c_/_w_e_e_k_l_y.  (See cron(8).)

     Each time a user logs in, the login program looks up the user's UID in
     the file llaassttlloogg.. If it is found, the timestamp of the last time the user
     logged in, the terminal line and the hostname are written to the standard
     output. (Providing the login is not _q_u_i_e_t, see login(1).)  The login pro-
     gram then records the new login time in the file llaassttlloogg.

     After the new _l_a_s_t_l_o_g record is written , the file uuttmmpp is opened and the
     _u_t_m_p record for the user inserted.  This record remains there until the
     user logs out at which time it is deleted.  The uuttmmpp file is used by the
     programs rwho(1), users(1), w(1), and who(1).

     Next, the login program opens the file wwttmmpp, and appends the user's _u_t_m_p
     record.  The same _u_t_m_p record, with an updated time stamp is later
     appended to the file when the user logs out. (See launchd(8).)  The wwttmmpp
     file is used by the programs last(1) and ac(8).

     In the event of a date change, a shutdown or reboot, the following items
     are logged in the wwttmmpp file.

     reboot
     shutdown    A system reboot or shutdown has been initiated.  The charac-
                 ter `~' is placed in the field _u_t___l_i_n_e, and reboot or
                 shutdown in the field _u_t___n_a_m_e.  (See shutdown(8) and
                 reboot(8).)

     date        The system time has been manually or automatically updated.
                 (See date(1).)  The command name date is recorded in the
                 field _u_t___n_a_m_e.  In the field _u_t___l_i_n_e, the character `|' indi-
                 cates the time prior to the change, and the character `{'
                 indicates the new time.

     ssaa -- print system accounting statistics

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
     ssaa [--aabbccddDDffiijjkkKKllmmnnqqrrssttuu] [--PP _f_i_l_e] [--UU _f_i_l_e] [--vv _c_u_t_o_f_f] [_f_i_l_e _._._.]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ssaa utility reports on, cleans up, and generally maintains system
     accounting files.

     The ssaa utility is able to condense the information in _/_v_a_r_/_a_c_c_o_u_n_t_/_a_c_c_t
     into the summary files _/_v_a_r_/_a_c_c_o_u_n_t_/_s_a_v_a_c_c_t and _/_v_a_r_/_a_c_c_o_u_n_t_/_u_s_r_a_c_c_t,
     which contain system statistics according to command name and login id,
     respectively.  This condensation is desirable because on a large system,
     _/_v_a_r_/_a_c_c_o_u_n_t_/_a_c_c_t can grow by hundreds of blocks per day.  The summary
     files are normally read before the accounting file, so that reports
     include all available information.

     If file names are supplied, they are read instead of _/_v_a_r_/_a_c_c_o_u_n_t_/_a_c_c_t.
     After each file is read, if the summary files are being updated, an
     updated summary will be saved to disk.  Only one report is printed, after
     the last file is processed.

     The labels used in the output indicate the following, except where other-
     wise specified by individual options:

     avio   Average number of I/O operations per execution

     cp     Sum of user and system time, in minutes

     cpu    Same as cp

     k      CPU-time averaged core usage, in 1k units

     k*sec  CPU storage integral, in 1k-core seconds

     re     Real time, in minutes

     s      System time, in minutes

     tio    Total number of I/O operations

     u      User time, in minutes

     The options to ssaa are:

     --aa      List all command names, including those containing unprintable
             characters and those used only once.  By default, ssaa places all
             names containing unprintable characters and those used only once
             under the name ``***other''.

     --bb      If printing command statistics, sort output by the sum of user
             and system time divided by number of calls.

     --cc      In addition to the number of calls and the user, system and real
             times for each command, print their percentage of the total over
             all commands.

     --dd      If printing command statistics, sort by the average number of
             disk I/O operations.  If printing user statistics, print the
             average number of disk I/O operations per user.

     --DD      If printing command statistics, sort and print by the total num-
             ber of disk I/O operations.

     --ff      Force no interactive threshold comparison with the --vv option.

     --ii      Do not read in the summary files.

     --jj      Instead of the total minutes per category, give seconds per call.

     --kk      If printing command statistics, sort by the cpu-time average mem-
             ory usage.  If printing user statistics, print the cpu-time aver-
             age memory usage.

     --KK      If printing command statistics, print and sort by the cpu-storage
             integral.

     --ll      Separate system and user time; normally they are combined.

     --mm      Print per-user statistics rather than per-command statistics.

     --nn      Sort by number of calls.

     --PP _f_i_l_e
             Use the specified _f_i_l_e for accessing the per-command accounting
             summary database, instead of the default _/_v_a_r_/_a_c_c_o_u_n_t_/_s_a_v_a_c_c_t.

     --qq      Create no output other than error messages.

     --rr      Reverse order of sort.

     --ss      Truncate the accounting files when done and merge their data into
             the summary files.

     --tt      For each command, report the ratio of real time to the sum of
             user and system cpu times.  If the cpu time is too small to
             report, ``*ignore*'' appears in this field.

     --UU _f_i_l_e
             Use the specified _f_i_l_e for accessing the per-user accounting sum-
             mary database, instead of the default _/_v_a_r_/_a_c_c_o_u_n_t_/_u_s_r_a_c_c_t.

     --uu      Superseding all other flags, for each entry in the accounting
             file, print the user ID, total seconds of cpu usage, total memory
             usage, number of I/O operations performed, and command name.

     --vv _c_u_t_o_f_f
             For each command used _c_u_t_o_f_f times or fewer, print the command
             name and await a reply from the terminal.  If the reply begins
             with ``y'', add the command to the category ``**junk**''.  This
             flag is used to strip garbage from the report.

     By default, per-command statistics will be printed.  The number of calls,
     the total elapsed time in minutes, total cpu and user time in minutes,
     average number of I/O operations, and CPU-time averaged core usage will
     be printed.  If the --mm option is specified, per-user statistics will be
     printed, including the user name, the number of commands invoked, total
     cpu time used (in minutes), total number of I/O operations, and CPU stor-
     age integral for each user.  If the --uu option is specified, the uid, user
     and system time (in seconds), CPU storage integral, I/O usage, and com-
     mand name will be printed for each entry in the accounting data file.

     If the --uu flag is specified, all flags other than --qq are ignored.  If the
     --mm flag is specified, only the --bb, --dd, --ii, --kk, --qq, and --ss flags are hon-
     ored.

     While the behavior of the options in this version of ssaa was modeled after
     the original version, there are some intentional differences and undoubt-
     edly some unintentional ones as well.  In particular, the --qq option has
     been added, and the --mm option now understands more options than it used
     to.

     The formats of the summary files created by this version of ssaa are very
     different from the those used by the original version.  This is not con-
     sidered a problem, however, because the accounting record format has
     changed as well (since user ids are now 32 bits).

     The number of options to this program is absurd, especially considering
     that there is not much logic behind their lettering.

     The field labels should be more consistent.

   iinnssttaallll _f_o_r_m_u_l_a:
       Install _f_o_r_m_u_l_a.

       _f_o_r_m_u_l_a is usually the name of the formula to install, but it has other
       syntaxes which are listed in the _S_P_E_C_I_F_Y_I_N_G _F_O_R_M_U_L_A_E section.

       Tap a formula repository.

       If no arguments are provided, list all installed taps.

       With _U_R_L unspecified, tap a formula repository from GitHub using HTTPS.
       Since so many taps are hosted on GitHub, this command is a shortcut for

       With  _U_R_L  specified, tap a formula repository from anywhere, using any
       transport protocol that ggiitt(1) handles. The one-argument  form  of  ttaapp
       simplifies  but also limits. This two-argument command makes no assump-
       tions, so taps can be cloned from places other than  GitHub  and  using
       protocols other than HTTPS, e.g. SSH, git, HTTP, FTP(S), rsync.

       ----ffuullll Convert  a shallow clone to a full clone without untapping. Taps

       Store and Whalebrew.

       bbrreeww bbuunnddllee [iinnssttaallll]
           Install and upgrade (by default) all dependencies  from  the  BBrreeww--
       ffiillee.

       You can skip the installation of dependencies by adding space-separated
       values to one or more of the  following  environment  variables:  HHOOMMEE--

       bbrreeww bbuunnddllee will output a BBrreewwffiillee..lloocckk..jjssoonn in the same  directory  as
       the  BBrreewwffiillee if all dependencies are installed successfully. This con-
       tains dependency and system status information which can be  useful  in
       debugging  bbrreeww  bbuunnddllee  failures  and  replicating  a ""last known good
       build"" state. You can opt-out of this behaviour by  setting  the  HHOOMMEE--
       BBRREEWW__BBUUNNDDLLEE__NNOO__LLOOCCKK  environment  variable  or  passing  the  ----nnoo--lloocckk
       option. You may wish to check this file into the same  version  control
       system  as your BBrreewwffiillee (or ensure your version control system ignores
       it if you'd prefer to  rely  on  debugging  information  from  a  local
       machine).

           Uninstall all dependencies not listed from the BBrreewwffiillee.

       This  workflow  is  useful  for  maintainers  or  testers who regularly
       install lots of formulae.

       This provides a successful exit code if everything is up-to-date,  mak-
       ing it useful for scripting.

           Run  an  external command in an isolated build environment based on
       the BBrreewwffiillee dependencies.

       This sanitized  build  environment  ignores  unrequested  dependencies,
       which  makes sure that things you didn't specify in your BBrreewwffiillee won't
       get picked up by commands like bbuunnddllee iinnssttaallll,  nnppmm  iinnssttaallll,  etc.  It
       will also add compiler flags which will help find keg-only dependencies
       like ooppeennssssll, iiccuu44cc, etc.

       Homebrew, like ggiitt(1), supports external commands. These are executable
       scripts  that  reside  somewhere  in  the  PPAATTHH,  named bbrreeww--_c_m_d_n_a_m_e or
       bbrreeww--_c_m_d_n_a_m_e..rrbb, which can be invoked like bbrreeww  _c_m_d_n_a_m_e.  This  allows
       you to create your own commands without modifying Homebrew's internals.

       Instructions for creating your own commands can be found in  the  docs:
       _h_t_t_p_s_:_/_/_d_o_c_s_._b_r_e_w_._s_h_/_E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l_-_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s

SSPPEECCIIFFYYIINNGG FFOORRMMUULLAAEE
       Many  Homebrew  commands  accept  one  or more _f_o_r_m_u_l_a arguments. These
       arguments can take several different forms:

       The name of a formula
              e.g. ggiitt, nnooddee, wwggeett.

       The fully-qualified name of a tapped formula
              Sometimes a formula from a tapped repository may  conflict  with
              one  in  hhoommeebbrreeww//ccoorree.  You  can still access these formulae by
              using a special syntax, e.g. hhoommeebbrreeww//dduuppeess//vviimm or hhoommeebbrreeww//vveerr--
              ssiioonnss//nnooddee44.

       An arbitrary file
              Homebrew can install formulae from a local path. It can point to
              either a formula file or a bottle.

       Many Homebrew Cask commands accept one or more  _c_a_s_k  arguments.  These
       can  be  specified  the  same way as the _f_o_r_m_u_l_a arguments described in
       SSPPEECCIIFFYYIINNGG FFOORRMMUULLAAEE above.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The first form of ffsscckk preens a standard set of filesystems or the speci-
     fied filesystems.  It is normally used in the script _/_e_t_c_/_r_c during auto-
     matic reboot.  Here ffsscckk reads the filesystem descriptor table (using
     getfsent(3)) to determine which filesystems to check.  Only partitions
     that have ``rw,'' ``rq'' or ``ro'' as options, and that have non-zero
     pass number are checked.  Filesystems with pass number 1 (normally just
     the root filesystem) are checked one at a time.  When pass 1 completes,
     all remaining filesystems are checked, running one process per disk
     drive.  The disk drive containing each filesystem is inferred from the
     shortest prefix of the device name that ends in one or more digits; the
     remaining characters are assumed to be the partition designator.  In
     preening mode, filesystems that are marked clean are skipped.  Filesys-
     tems are marked clean when they are unmounted, when they have been
     mounted read-only, or when ffsscckk runs on them successfully.

     It should be noted that ffsscckk is now essentially a wrapper that invokes
     other _f_s_c_k___X_X_X utilities as needed.  Currently, ffsscckk can invoke _f_s_c_k___h_f_s,
     _f_s_c_k___a_p_f_s, _f_s_c_k___m_s_d_o_s, _f_s_c_k___e_x_f_a_t, and _f_s_c_k___u_d_f.  If this underlying
     process that ffsscckk invokes encounters serious inconsistencies or the
     filesystem type is not one of the above, it exits with an abnormal return
     status and an automatic reboot will then fail.  For each corrected incon-
     sistency one or more lines will be printed identifying the filesystem on
     which the correction will take place, and the nature of the correction.

     If sent a QUIT signal, ffsscckk will finish the filesystem checks, then exit
     with an abnormal return status that causes an automatic reboot to fail.
     This is useful when you want to finish the filesystem checks during an
     automatic reboot, but do not want the machine to come up multiuser after
     the checks complete.

     Without the --pp option, ffsscckk audits and interactively repairs inconsistent
     conditions for filesystems.  It should be noted that some of the correc-
     tive actions which are not correctable under the --pp option will result in
     some loss of data.  The amount and severity of data lost may be deter-
     mined from the diagnostic output.  If the operator does not have write
     permission on the filesystem ffsscckk will default to a --nn action.

     The following flags are interpreted by ffsscckk and passed along to the
     underlying tool that it spawns.

     --ff          Force fsck to check `clean' filesystems when preening.

     --ll          Limit the number of parallel checks to the number specified
                 in the following argument.  By default, the limit is the num-
                 ber of disks, running one process per disk.  If a smaller
                 limit is given, the disks are checked round-robin, one
                 filesystem at a time.

     --RR          Specify a particular passno number for which fsck is to
                 check.  You may only specify 1 or 2.  Only those filesystems
                 matching that particular passno entry (if using fstab) will
                 be checked.  For more information on the passno field, see
                 fstab(5).

     --pp          ""Preen"" mode, described above.

     --qq          Do a quick check to determine if the filesystem was unmounted
                 cleanly.

     --yy          Assume a yes response to all questions asked by ffsscckk; this
                 should be used with great caution as this is a free license
                 to continue after essentially unlimited trouble has been
                 encountered.

     --nn          Assume a no response to all questions asked by ffsscckk except
                 for `CONTINUE?', which is assumed to be affirmative; do not
                 open the filesystem for writing.

     If no filesystems are given to ffsscckk then a default list of filesystems is
     read using getfsent(3).

     Because of inconsistencies between the block device and the buffer cache,
     the raw device should always be used.

     Unless otherwise specified or noted below the default rrppccbbiinndd protocol
     version is 3.  With no or only generic options, call the rrppccbbiinndd dump
     procedure on the specified _h_o_s_t or ``localhost'' if _h_o_s_t is not specified
     and display the results.  For versions 3 and 4 display the program num-
     ber, the version, the ``netid'', the universal address that the services
     is listening on, symbolic name of the program if known, and then the
     owner that registered the <program, version, netid, address> tuple.  For
     version 2 of the protocol list the program, version, protocol, port, and
     symbolic program name.  _S_e_e _t_h_e ----ssuummmmaarryy _o_p_t_i_o_n _b_e_l_o_w _f_o_r _a _t_y_p_i_c_a_l_l_y

     procedure.

     The _p_r_o_g_r_a_m argument can be either a name or a number.

     If a version is specified, rpcinfo attempts to call that version of the
     specified program.  Otherwise, if the version is optional rrppcciinnffoo
     attempts to find all the registered version numbers for the specified
     program by calling version 0 (which is presumed not to exist; if it does
     exist, rpcinfo attempts to obtain this information by calling an
     extremely high version number instead) and attempts to call each regis-
     tered version.

     A required transport option is needed for the second and third lines of
     the synopsis which is used to ping, i.e., call the null procedure of the
     specified program and version. The results will be displayed on stdout.
     If version is not specified each valid version found as described above
     will be called.  The third synopsis will use the supplied universal
     address over the transport specified by _n_e_t_i_d to call the null procedure
     of the specified _p_r_o_g_r_a_m in the same manner as above. In addition the
     last two lines of the synopsis can ``ping'' the server as described in
     the LLeeggaaccyy OOppttiioonnss section below.

     In summary mode the maximum number of versions and transports is 16. The
     first 16 versions and the first 16 transports received from the server
     are displayed and the rest is silently ignored.

     In the second synopsis line, for a host that is specified as a link-local
     INET6 address will always return ``no route to host''.

     In releases prior to SunOS 3.0, the Network File System (NFS) did not
     register itself with the portmapper; rrppcciinnffoo cannot be used to make RPC
     calls to the NFS server on hosts running such releases.

     ssyyssccttll -- get or set kernel state

     ssyyssccttll [--bbddeehhiiNNnnooqqxx] _n_a_m_e[=_v_a_l_u_e] _._._.
     ssyyssccttll [--bbddeehhNNnnooqqxx] --aa

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ssyyssccttll utility retrieves kernel state and allows processes with
     appropriate privilege to set kernel state.  The state to be retrieved or
     set is described using a ``Management Information Base'' (``MIB'') style
     name, described as a dotted set of components.

     The following options are available:

     --AA      Equivalent to --oo --aa (for compatibility).

     --aa      List all the currently available non-opaque values.  This option
             is ignored if one or more variable names are specified on the
             command line.

     --bb      Force the value of the variable(s) to be output in raw, binary
             format.  No names are printed and no terminating newlines are
             output.  This is mostly useful with a single variable.

     --dd      Print the description of the variable instead of its value.

     --ee      Separate the name and the value of the variable(s) with `='.
             This is useful for producing output which can be fed back to the
             ssyyssccttll utility.  This option is ignored if either --NN or --nn is
             specified, or a variable is being set.

     --hh      Format output for human, rather than machine, readability.

     --ii      Ignore unknown OIDs.  The purpose is to make use of ssyyssccttll for
             collecting data from a variety of machines (not all of which are
             necessarily running exactly the same software) easier.

     --NN      Show only variable names, not their values.  This is particularly
             useful with shells that offer programmable completion.  To enable
             completion of variable names in zsh(1) (_p_o_r_t_s_/_s_h_e_l_l_s_/_z_s_h), use
             the following code:

                   listsysctls () { set -A reply $(sysctl -AN ${1%.*}) }
                   compctl -K listsysctls sysctl

             To enable completion of variable names in tcsh(1), use:

                   complete sysctl 'n/*/`sysctl -Na`/'

     --nn      Show only variable values, not their names.  This option is use-
             ful for setting shell variables.  For instance, to save the page-
             size in variable _p_s_i_z_e, use:

                   set psize=`sysctl -n hw.pagesize`

     --oo      Show opaque variables (which are normally suppressed).  The for-
             mat and length are printed, as well as a hex dump of the first
             sixteen bytes of the value.

     --qq      Suppress some warnings generated by ssyyssccttll to standard error.

     --XX      Equivalent to --xx --aa (for compatibility).

     --xx      As --oo, but prints a hex dump of the entire value instead of just
             the first few bytes.

     The information available from ssyyssccttll consists of integers, strings, and
     opaque types.  The ssyyssccttll utility only knows about a couple of opaque
     types, and will resort to hexdumps for the rest.  The opaque information
     is much more useful if retrieved by special purpose programs such as
     ps(1), systat(1), and netstat(1).

     The string and integer information is summarized below.  For a detailed
     description of these variable see sysctl(3).

     The changeable column indicates whether a process with appropriate privi-
     lege can change the value.  String and integer values can be set using
     ssyyssccttll.

       Combining  Characters  that are supposed to display on the character at
       the last column on the screen may display one column early, or they may
       not display at all.

       Combining  Characters  never  count as different in _-_-_d_i_f_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s mode.

       Blank lines directly after a line which ends in the last column do  not
       display.

       to compensate for a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d that takes more than  _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l  seconds  to
       execute.   wwaattcchh also can get into a state where it rapid-fires as many
       executions of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d as it can to catch up from a previous  executions
       running longer than _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l (for example, nneettssttaatt taking ages on a DNS

       The  bbeeeepp  and ffllaasshh routines are used to alert the terminal user.  The
       routine bbeeeepp sounds an audible alarm on the terminal, if possible; oth-

       the screen, and if that is not possible, sounds the alert.  If  neither

     The hheexxdduummpp utility is a filter which displays the specified files, or

     mat.

     The options are as follows:

             decimal bytes, followed by the same sixteen bytes in %_p format
             enclosed in ``|'' characters.

     --ff _f_o_r_m_a_t___f_i_l_e
             Specify a file that contains one or more newline separated format
             strings.  Empty lines and lines whose first non-blank character
             is a hash mark (##) are ignored.

     --nn _l_e_n_g_t_h
             Interpret only _l_e_n_g_t_h bytes of input.

             followed by eight space-separated, six column, zero-filled, two
             byte quantities of input data, in octal, per line.

     --ss _o_f_f_s_e_t
             Skip _o_f_f_s_e_t bytes from the beginning of the input.  By default,
             _o_f_f_s_e_t is interpreted as a decimal number.  With a leading 00xx or
             00XX, _o_f_f_s_e_t is interpreted as a hexadecimal number, otherwise,
             with a leading 00, _o_f_f_s_e_t is interpreted as an octal number.
             Appending the character bb, kk, mm, or gg to _o_f_f_s_e_t causes it to be
             interpreted as a multiple of 512, 1024, 1048576, or 1073741824,
             respectively.

     --vv      Cause hheexxdduummpp to display all input data.  Without the --vv option,
             any number of groups of output lines, which would be identical to
             the immediately preceding group of output lines (except for the
             input offsets), are replaced with a line comprised of a single
             asterisk.

     --xx      _T_w_o_-_b_y_t_e _h_e_x_a_d_e_c_i_m_a_l _d_i_s_p_l_a_y.  Display the input offset in hexa-
             decimal, followed by eight, space separated, four column, zero-
             filled, two-byte quantities of input data, in hexadecimal, per
             line.

     For each input file, hheexxdduummpp sequentially copies the input to standard
     output, transforming the data according to the format strings specified
     by the --ee and --ff options, in the order that they were specified.

   FFoorrmmaattss
     A format string contains any number of format units, separated by white-
     space.  A format unit contains up to three items: an iteration count, a
     byte count, and a format.

     The iteration count is an optional positive integer, which defaults to
     one.  Each format is applied iteration count times.

     The byte count is an optional positive integer.  If specified it defines
     the number of bytes to be interpreted by each iteration of the format.

     If an iteration count and/or a byte count is specified, a single slash
     must be placed after the iteration count and/or before the byte count to
     disambiguate them.  Any whitespace before or after the slash is ignored.

     The format is required and must be surrounded by double quote ("" "")
     marks.  It is interpreted as a fprintf-style format string (see
     fprintf(3)), with the following exceptions:

           ++oo   An asterisk (*) may not be used as a field width or precision.

           ++oo   A byte count or field precision _i_s required for each ``s'' con-
               version character (unlike the fprintf(3) default which prints
               the entire string if the precision is unspecified).

           ++oo   The conversion characters ``h'', ``l'', ``n'', ``p'' and ``q''
               are not supported.

           ++oo   The single character escape sequences described in the C stan-
               dard are supported:

                     NUL                  \0
                     <alert character>    \a
                     <backspace>          \b
                     <form-feed>          \f
                     <newline>            \n
                     <carriage return>    \r
                     <tab>                \t
                     <vertical tab>       \v

     The hheexxdduummpp utility also supports the following additional conversion
     strings:

     __aa[ddooxx]     Display the input offset, cumulative across input files, of
                 the next byte to be displayed.  The appended characters dd, oo,
                 and xx specify the display base as decimal, octal or hexadeci-
                 mal respectively.

     __AA[ddooxx]     Identical to the __aa conversion string except that it is only
                 performed once, when all of the input data has been pro-
                 cessed.

     __cc          Output characters in the default character set.  Nonprinting

     The default and supported byte counts for the conversion characters are
     as follows:

           %_c, %_p, %_u, %c       One byte counts only.

           %d, %i, %o, %u, %X, %x  Four byte default, one, two and four byte
                                   counts supported.

           %E, %e, %f, %G, %g      Eight byte default, four and twelve byte
                                   counts supported.

     The amount of data interpreted by each format string is the sum of the
     data required by each format unit, which is the iteration count times the
     byte count, or the iteration count times the number of bytes required by
     the format if the byte count is not specified.

     The input is manipulated in ``blocks'', where a block is defined as the
     largest amount of data specified by any format string.  Format strings
     interpreting less than an input block's worth of data, whose last format
     unit both interprets some number of bytes and does not have a specified
     iteration count, have the iteration count incremented until the entire
     input block has been processed or there is not enough data remaining in
     the block to satisfy the format string.

     If, either as a result of user specification or hheexxdduummpp modifying the
     iteration count as described above, an iteration count is greater than
     one, no trailing whitespace characters are output during the last itera-
     tion.

     It is an error to specify a byte count as well as multiple conversion
     characters or strings unless all but one of the conversion characters or
     strings is __aa or __AA.

     If, as a result of the specification of the --nn option or end-of-file
     being reached, input data only partially satisfies a format string, the
     input block is zero-padded sufficiently to display all available data
     (i.e., any format units overlapping the end of data will display some
     number of the zero bytes).

     Further output by such format strings is replaced by an equivalent number
     of spaces.  An equivalent number of spaces is defined as the number of
     spaces output by an ss conversion character with the same field width and
     precision as the original conversion character or conversion string but
     with any ``+'', `` '', ``#'' conversion flag characters removed, and ref-
     erencing a NULL string.

     If no format strings are specified, the default display is a one-byte
     hexadecimal display.

     ssccrriipptt -- make typescript of terminal session

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
     ssccrriipptt [--aaddkkppqqrr] [--FF _p_i_p_e] [--tt _t_i_m_e] [_f_i_l_e [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d _._._.]]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ssccrriipptt utility makes a typescript of everything printed on your ter-
     minal.  It is useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an inter-
     active session as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file can be
     printed out later with lpr(1).

     If the argument _f_i_l_e is given, ssccrriipptt saves all dialogue in _f_i_l_e.  If no
     file name is given, the typescript is saved in the file _t_y_p_e_s_c_r_i_p_t.

     If the argument _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is given, ssccrriipptt will run the specified command
     with an optional argument vector instead of an interactive shell.

     The following options are available:

     --aa      Append the output to _f_i_l_e or _t_y_p_e_s_c_r_i_p_t, retaining the prior con-
             tents.

     --dd      When playing back a session with the --pp flag, do not sleep
             between records when playing back a timestamped session.

     --FF _p_i_p_e
             Immediately flush output after each write.  This will allow a
             user to create a named pipe using mkfifo(1) and another user may
             watch the live session using a utility like cat(1).

     --kk      Log keys sent to the program as well as output.

     --pp      Play back a session recorded with the --rr flag in real time.

     --qq      Run in quiet mode, omit the start, stop and command status mes-
             sages.

     --rr      Record a session with input, output, and timestamping.

     --tt _t_i_m_e
             Specify the interval at which the script output file will be
             flushed to disk, in seconds.  A value of 0 causes ssccrriipptt to flush
             after every character I/O event.  The default interval is 30 sec-
             onds.

     The script ends when the forked shell (or command) exits (a _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_-_D to
     exit the Bourne shell (sh(1)), and _e_x_i_t, _l_o_g_o_u_t or _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_-_D (if
     _i_g_n_o_r_e_e_o_f is not set) for the C-shell, csh(1)).

     Certain interactive commands, such as vi(1), create garbage in the type-
     script file.  The ssccrriipptt utility works best with commands that do not
     manipulate the screen.  The results are meant to emulate a hardcopy ter-
     minal, not an addressable one.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     The following environment variables are utilized by ssccrriipptt:

     SCRIPT
            The SCRIPT environment variable is added to the sub-shell.  If
            SCRIPT already existed in the users environment, its value is
            overwritten within the sub-shell.  The value of SCRIPT is the name
            of the _t_y_p_e_s_c_r_i_p_t file.

     SHELL  If the variable SHELL exists, the shell forked by ssccrriipptt will be
            that shell.  If SHELL is not set, the Bourne shell is assumed.
            (Most shells set this variable automatically).

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The ssccrriipptt command appeared in 3.0BSD.

     The --dd, --pp and --rr options first appeared in NetBSD 2.0 and were ported to
     FreeBSD 9.2.

BBUUGGSS
     The ssccrriipptt utility places eevveerryytthhiinngg in the log file, including linefeeds
     and backspaces.  This is not what the naive user expects.

     It is not possible to specify a command without also naming the script
     file because of argument parsing compatibility issues.

     When running in --kk mode, echo cancelling is far from ideal.  The slave
     terminal mode is checked for ECHO mode to check when to avoid manual echo
     logging.  This does not work when the terminal is in a raw mode where the
     program being run is doing manual echo.

     If ssccrriipptt reads zero bytes from the terminal, it switches to a mode when
     it only attempts to read once a second until there is data to read.  This
     prevents ssccrriipptt from spinning on zero-byte reads, but might cause a
     1-second delay in processing of user input.

             Tells llllddbb to read in and execute the file ""_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e"", which
             should contain llllddbb commands.

             Do not automatically parse any '.lldbinit' files.

             (If you do not provide -f then the first argument will be the
             file to be debugged so 'lldb -- <filename> [<ARG1> [<ARG2>]]'
             also works.  Remember to end the options with ""--"" if any of your
             arguments have a ""-"" in them.)

UUSSIINNGG LLLLDDBB
     In llllddbb there is a hheellpp command which can be used to find descriptions
     and examples of all llllddbb commands.  To get help on ""bbrreeaakkppooiinntt sseett"" you
     would type ""hheellpp bbrreeaakkppooiinntt sseett"".

     There is also an aapprrooppooss command which will search the help text of all
     commands for a given term -- this is useful for locating a command by
     topic.  For instance, ""aapprrooppooss bbrreeaakkppooiinntt"" will list any command that has
     the word ""bbrreeaakkppooiinntt"" in its help text.

FFIILLEESS
     llllddbb will read settings/aliases/commands from three files at startup, if
     they exist.

     First, it will read a _~_/_._l_l_d_b_i_n_i_t_-_d_e_b_u_g_g_e_r command file.  If you are
     using the llllddbb command line interface, this is _~_/_._l_l_d_b_i_n_i_t_-_l_l_d_b.  If you
     are using llllddbb inside a GUI debugger like XXccooddee this will be
     _~_/_._l_l_d_b_i_n_i_t_-_X_c_o_d_e.  This is a useful place to put settings that you want
     to apply only when a given llllddbb command interpreter is used.

     Second, _~_/_._l_l_d_b_i_n_i_t is read.

     Third, an _._l_l_d_b_i_n_i_t file in the current working directory (where llllddbb is
     started) will be read.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     The LLDB project page http://lldb.llvm.org/ has many different resources
     for llllddbb users -- the gdb/lldb command equivalence page
     http://lldb.llvm.org/lldb-gdb.html can be especially helpful for users
     coming from gdb.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     sssshh--aadddd adds private key identities to the authentication agent,
     ssh-agent(1).  When run without arguments, it adds the files
     _~_/_._s_s_h_/_i_d___r_s_a, _~_/_._s_s_h_/_i_d___d_s_a, _~_/_._s_s_h_/_i_d___e_c_d_s_a, and _~_/_._s_s_h_/_i_d___e_d_2_5_5_1_9.
     After loading a private key, sssshh--aadddd will try to load corresponding cer-
     tificate information from the filename obtained by appending _-_c_e_r_t_._p_u_b to
     the name of the private key file.  Alternative file names can be given on
     the command line.

     If any file requires a passphrase, sssshh--aadddd asks for the passphrase from
     the user.  The passphrase is read from the user's tty.  sssshh--aadddd retries
     the last passphrase if multiple identity files are given.

     The authentication agent must be running and the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environ-
     ment variable must contain the name of its socket for sssshh--aadddd to work.

     The options are as follows:

     --cc      Indicates that added identities should be subject to confirmation
             before being used for authentication.  Confirmation is performed
             by ssh-askpass(1).  Successful confirmation is signaled by a zero
             exit status from ssh-askpass(1), rather than text entered into
             the requester.

     --DD      Deletes all identities from the agent.

     --dd      Instead of adding identities, removes identities from the agent.
             If sssshh--aadddd has been run without arguments, the keys for the
             default identities and their corresponding certificates will be
             removed.  Otherwise, the argument list will be interpreted as a
             list of paths to public key files to specify keys and certifi-
             cates to be removed from the agent.  If no public key is found at
             a given path, sssshh--aadddd will append _._p_u_b and retry.

     --EE _f_i_n_g_e_r_p_r_i_n_t___h_a_s_h
             Specifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key finger-
             prints.  Valid options are: ``md5'' and ``sha256''.  The default
             is ``sha256''.

     --ee _p_k_c_s_1_1
             Remove keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared library _p_k_c_s_1_1.

     --kk      When loading keys into or deleting keys from the agent, process
             plain private keys only and skip certificates.

     --LL      Lists public key parameters of all identities currently repre-
             sented by the agent.

     --ll      Lists fingerprints of all identities currently represented by the
             agent.

     --qq      Be quiet after a successful operation.

     --ss _p_k_c_s_1_1
             Add keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared library _p_k_c_s_1_1.

     --tt _l_i_f_e
             Set a maximum lifetime when adding identities to an agent.  The
             lifetime may be specified in seconds or in a time format speci-
             fied in sshd_config(5).

     --XX      Unlock the agent.

     --xx      Lock the agent with a password.

     --KK      When adding identities, each passphrase will also be stored in
             the user's keychain.  When removing identities with --dd, each
             passphrase will be removed from it.

     --AA      Add identities to the agent using any passphrase stored in the
             user's keychain.

     DISPLAY and SSH_ASKPASS
             If sssshh--aadddd needs a passphrase, it will read the passphrase from
             the current terminal if it was run from a terminal.  If sssshh--aadddd
             does not have a terminal associated with it but DISPLAY and
             SSH_ASKPASS are set, it will execute the program specified by
             SSH_ASKPASS (by default ``ssh-askpass'') and open an X11 window
             to read the passphrase.  This is particularly useful when calling
             sssshh--aadddd from a _._x_s_e_s_s_i_o_n or related script.  (Note that on some
             machines it may be necessary to redirect the input from _/_d_e_v_/_n_u_l_l
             to make this work.)

     SSH_AUTH_SOCK
             Identifies the path of a UNIX-domain socket used to communicate
             with the agent.

       ttiicc - the _t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o entry-description compiler

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       ttiicc  [--11CCGGIILLNNTTUUVVaaccffggrrssttxx]  [--ee  _n_a_m_e_s]  [--oo  _d_i_r]  [--RR  _s_u_b_s_e_t] [--vv[_n]]
       [--ww[_n]] _f_i_l_e

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The command ttiicc translates a tteerrmmiinnffoo file from source format into com-
       piled  format.   The  compiled  format  is  necessary  for use with the
       library routines in nnccuurrsseess(3X).

       The results are  normally  placed  in  the  system  terminfo  directory
       //uussrr//sshhaarree//tteerrmmiinnffoo.  There are two ways to change this behavior.

       First, you may override the system default by setting the variable TTEERR--
       MMIINNFFOO in your shell environment to a valid (existing) directory name.

       Secondly, if ttiicc cannot get access to _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o or your  TER-
       MINFO  directory,  it  looks for the directory _$_H_O_M_E_/_._t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o; if that
       directory exists, the entry is placed there.

       Libraries that read terminfo entries are expected to check for  a  TER-
       MINFO  directory first, look at _$_H_O_M_E_/_._t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o if TERMINFO is not set,
       and finally look in _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o.

       --11     restricts the output to a single column

       --aa     tells ttiicc to retain commented-out capabilities rather than  dis-
              carding them.  Capabilities are commented by prefixing them with
              a period.  This sets the --xx option, because it treats  the  com-
              mented-out  entries  as  user-defined  names.   If the source is
              termcap, accept the 2-character names  required  by  version  6.
              Otherwise these are ignored.

       --CC     Force  source translation to termcap format.  Note: this differs
              from the --CC option of iinnffooccmmpp(1M) in that  it  does  not  merely
              translate capability names, but also translates terminfo strings
              to termcap format.  Capabilities that are not  translatable  are
              left  in  the entry under their terminfo names but commented out
              with two preceding dots.

       --cc     tells ttiicc to only check _f_i_l_e for errors, including syntax  prob-
              lems  and  bad  use  links.   If  you  specify --CC (--II) with this
              option, the code will print warnings about entries which,  after
              use  resolution, are more than 1023 (4096) bytes long.  Due to a
              fixed buffer length in older termcap libraries (and a documented
              limit in terminfo), these entries may cause core dumps.

       --ee _n_a_m_e_s
              Limit  writes  and translations to the following comma-separated
              list of terminals.  If any name or alias of a  terminal  matches
              one  of  the  names  in  the  list, the entry will be written or
              translated as normal.  Otherwise no output will be generated for
              it.   The  option  value is interpreted as a file containing the
              list if it contains a '/'.  (Note: depending on how tic was com-
              piled, this option may require --II or --CC.)

       --ff     Display     complex     terminfo     strings    which    contain
              if/then/else/endif expressions indented for readability.

       --GG     Display constant literals in  decimal  form  rather  than  their
              character equivalents.

       --gg     Display  constant  character literals in quoted form rather than
              their decimal equivalents.

       --II     Force source translation to terminfo format.

       --LL     Force source translation to terminfo format  using  the  long  C
              variable names listed in <tteerrmm..hh>

       --NN     Disable smart defaults.  Normally, when translating from termcap
              to terminfo, the compiler makes a number  of  assumptions  about
              the   defaults   of   string  capabilities  rreesseett11__ssttrriinngg,  ccaarr--
              rriiaaggee__rreettuurrnn,  ccuurrssoorr__lleefftt,  ccuurrssoorr__ddoowwnn,  ssccrroollll__ffoorrwwaarrdd,  ttaabb,

              use obsolete termcap capabilities to deduce correct values.   It
              also normally suppresses output of obsolete termcap capabilities
              such as bbss.  This option forces a more literal translation  that
              also preserves the obsolete capabilities.

       --oo_d_i_r  Write  compiled  entries to given directory.  Overrides the TER-
              MINFO environment variable.

       --RR_s_u_b_s_e_t
              Restrict output to a given subset.  This option is for use  with
              archaic  versions  of  terminfo  like  those on SVr1, Ultrix, or
              HP/UX that do not support the full set of SVR4/XSI  Curses  ter-
              minfo;  and  outright  broken ports like AIX 3.x that have their
              own extensions incompatible with  SVr4/XSI.   Available  subsets
              are ""SVr1"", ""Ultrix"", ""HP"", ""BSD"" and ""AIX""; see tteerrmmiinnffoo(5) for
              details.

       --rr     Force entry resolution (so there are no remaining  tc  capabili-
              ties)  even  when doing translation to termcap format.  This may
              be needed if you are preparing a  termcap  file  for  a  termcap
              library  (such as GNU termcap through version 1.3 or BSD termcap
              through 4.3BSD) that does not handle  multiple  tc  capabilities
              per entry.

       --ss     Summarize  the  compile  by  showing  the  directory  into which
              entries are written, and the number of entries  which  are  com-
              piled.

       --TT     eliminates  size-restrictions  on  the  generated text.  This is
              mainly useful for  testing  and  analysis,  since  the  compiled
              descriptions  are limited (e.g., 1023 for termcap, 4096 for ter-
              minfo).

       --tt     tells ttiicc to discard commented-out capabilities.  Normally  when
              translating  from  terminfo to termcap, untranslatable capabili-
              ties are commented-out.

       --UU   tells ttiicc to not post-process the data after  parsing  the  source
            file.  Normally, it infers data which is commonly missing in older
            terminfo data, or in termcaps.

       --VV   reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and
            exits.

       --vv_n  specifies that (verbose) output be written to standard error trace
            information showing ttiicc's progress.  The optional parameter _n is a
            number  from  1  to 10, inclusive, indicating the desired level of
            detail of information.  If _n is omitted, the default level  is  1.
            If  _n  is  specified  and  greater  than 1, the level of detail is
            increased.

       --ww_n  specifies the width of the output.  The parameter is optional.  If
            it is omitted, it defaults to 60.

       --xx   Treat  unknown capabilities as user-defined.  That is, if you sup-
            ply a capability name which ttiicc does not recognize, it will  infer
            its  type  (boolean, number or string) from the syntax and make an
            extended table entry for that.   User-defined  capability  strings
            whose name begins with ``k'' are treated as function keys.

       _f_i_l_e contains one or more tteerrmmiinnffoo terminal descriptions in source for-
            mat [see tteerrmmiinnffoo(5)].  Each description in the file describes the
            capabilities of a particular terminal.

       The debug flag levels are as follows:

       1      Names of files created and linked

       2      Information related to the ``use'' facility

       3      Statistics from the hashing algorithm

       5      String-table memory allocations

       7      Entries into the string-table

       8      List of tokens encountered by scanner

       9      All values computed in construction of the hash table

       If the debug level _n is not given, it is taken to be one.

       All  but  one  of  the capabilities recognized by ttiicc are documented in
       tteerrmmiinnffoo(5).  The exception is the uussee capability.

       When a uussee=_e_n_t_r_y-_n_a_m_e field is discovered in a terminal entry currently
       being  compiled,  ttiicc  reads  in the binary from //uussrr//sshhaarree//tteerrmmiinnffoo to
       complete the entry.  (Entries created from _f_i_l_e will be used first.  If
       the  environment  variable  TTEERRMMIINNFFOO is set, that directory is searched
       instead of //uussrr//sshhaarree//tteerrmmiinnffoo.)  ttiicc duplicates  the  capabilities  in
       _e_n_t_r_y-_n_a_m_e for the current entry, with the exception of those capabili-
       ties that explicitly are defined in the current entry.

       When an entry, e.g., eennttrryy__nnaammee__11, contains a  uussee==_e_n_t_r_y__n_a_m_e__2  field,
       any   canceled   capabilities  in  _e_n_t_r_y__n_a_m_e__2  must  also  appear  in
       eennttrryy__nnaammee__11 before uussee== for  these  capabilities  to  be  canceled  in
       eennttrryy__nnaammee__11.

       If  the  environment variable TTEERRMMIINNFFOO is set, the compiled results are
       placed there instead of //uussrr//sshhaarree//tteerrmmiinnffoo.

       Total compiled entries cannot exceed 4096 bytes.  The name field cannot
       exceed  512  bytes.   Terminal names exceeding the maximum alias length
       (32 characters on systems with long filenames, 14 characters otherwise)
       will  be  truncated  to  the maximum alias length and a warning message
       will be printed.

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
       There is  some  evidence  that  historic  ttiicc  implementations  treated
       description  fields with no whitespace in them as additional aliases or
       short names.  This ttiicc does not do that, but it does warn when descrip-
       tion  fields may be treated that way and check them for dangerous char-
       acters.

EEXXTTEENNSSIIOONNSS
       Unlike the stock SVr4 ttiicc command,  this  implementation  can  actually
       compile termcap sources.  In fact, entries in terminfo and termcap syn-
       tax can be mixed in a single source file.  See tteerrmmiinnffoo(5) for the list
       of termcap names taken to be equivalent to terminfo names.

       The  SVr4  manual  pages  are not clear on the resolution rules for uussee
       capabilities.  This implementation of ttiicc will find  uussee  targets  any-
       where  in  the source file, or anywhere in the file tree rooted at TTEERR--
       MMIINNFFOO (if TTEERRMMIINNFFOO is defined), or in the user's _$_H_O_M_E_/_._t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o direc-
       tory (if it exists), or (finally) anywhere in the system's file tree of
       compiled entries.

       The error messages from this ttiicc have the same format as  GNU  C  error
       messages, and can be parsed by GNU Emacs's compile facility.

       The  --CC,  --GG, --II, --NN, --RR, --TT, --VV, --aa, --ee, --ff, --gg, --oo, --rr, --ss, --tt and --xx
       options are not supported under SVr4.  The SVr4 --cc mode does not report
       bad use links.

       System  V  does  not  compile  entries  to  or  read  entries from your
       _$_H_O_M_E_/_._t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o directory unless TERMINFO is explicitly set to it.

     Powers of units can be specified using the '^' character as shown in the
     example, or by simple concatenation: 'cm3' is equivalent to 'cm^3'.  Mul-
     tiplication of units can be specified by using spaces, a dash or an
     asterisk.  Division of units is indicated by the slash ('/').  Note that
     multiplication has a higher precedence than division, so 'm/s/s' is the
     same as 'm/s^2' or 'm/s s'.  Division of numbers must be indicated using
     the vertical bar ('|').  To convert half a meter, you would write '1|2
     meter'.  If you write '1/2 meter' then the units program would interpret
     that as equivalent to '0.5/meter'.  If you enter incompatible unit types,
     the units program will print a message indicating that the units are not
     conformable and it will display the reduced form for each unit:

         You have: ergs/hour
         You want: fathoms kg^2 / day
         conformability error
                 2.7777778e-11 kg m^2 / sec^3
                 2.1166667e-05 kg^2 m / sec

     The conversion information is read from a units data file.  The default
     file includes definitions for most familiar units, abbreviations and met-
     ric prefixes.  Some constants of nature included are:

           pi         ratio of circumference to diameter
           c          speed of light
           e          charge on an electron
           g          acceleration of gravity
           force      same as g
           mole       Avogadro's number
           water      pressure per unit height of water
           mercury    pressure per unit height of mercury
           au         astronomical unit

     The unit 'pound' is a unit of mass.  Compound names are run together so
     'pound force' is a unit of force.  The unit 'ounce' is also a unit of
     mass.  The fluid ounce is 'floz'.  British units that differ from their
     US counterparts are prefixed with 'br', and currency is prefixed with its
     country name: 'belgiumfranc', 'britainpound'.  When searching for a unit,
     if the specified string does not appear exactly as a unit name, then
     uunniittss will try to remove a trailing 's' or a trailing 'es' and check
     again for a match.

     To find out what units are available read the standard units file.  If
     you want to add your own units you can supply your own file.  A unit is
     specified on a single line by giving its name and an equivalence.  Be
     careful to define new units in terms of old ones so that a reduction
     leads to the primitive units which are marked with '!' characters.  The
     uunniittss program will not detect infinite loops that could be caused by
     careless unit definitions.  Comments in the unit definition file begin
     with a '/' character at the beginning of a line.

     Prefixes are defined in the same was as standard units, but with a trail-
     ing dash at the end of the prefix name.  If a unit is not found even
     after removing trailing 's' or 'es', then it will be checked against the
     list of prefixes.  Prefixes will be removed until a legal base unit is
     identified.

     Here is an example of a short units file that defines some basic units.

           m         !a!
           sec       !b!
           micro-    1e-6

     The effect of including a '/' in a prefix is surprising.

     Exponents entered by the user can be only one digit.  You can work around
     this by multiplying several terms.

     The user must use | to indicate division of numbers and / to indicate
     division of symbols.  This distinction should not be necessary.

     The program contains various arbitrary limits on the length of the units
     converted and on the length of the data file.

     The program should use a hash table to store units so that it does not
     take so long to load the units list and check for duplication.

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The rreennaammee() system call causes the link named _o_l_d to be renamed as _n_e_w.
     If _n_e_w exists, it is first removed.  Both _o_l_d and _n_e_w must be of the same
     type (that is, both must be either directories or non-directories) and
     must reside on the same file system.

     The rreennaammee() system call guarantees that an instance of _n_e_w will always
     exist, even if the system should crash in the middle of the operation.

     If the final component of _o_l_d is a symbolic link, the symbolic link is
     renamed, not the file or directory to which it points.

     The rreennaammeeaatt() system call is equivalent to rreennaammee() except in the case
     where either _f_r_o_m or _t_o specifies a relative path.  If _f_r_o_m is a relative
     path, the file to be renamed is located relative to the directory associ-
     ated with the file descriptor _f_r_o_m_f_d instead of the current working
     directory.  If the _t_o is a relative path, the same happens only relative
     to the directory associated with _t_o_f_d.  If the rreennaammeeaatt() is passed the
     special value AT_FDCWD in the _f_r_o_m_f_d or _t_o_f_d parameter, the current work-
     ing directory is used in the determination of the file for the respective
     path parameter.

     The rreennaammeexx__nnpp() and rreennaammeeaattxx__nnpp() system calls are similar to their
     counterparts except that they take a _f_l_a_g_s argument.  Values for _f_l_a_g_s
     are constructed with below bits set:

           RENAME_SWAP   On file systems that support it (see getattrlist(2)
                         VOL_CAP_INT_RENAME_SWAP), it will cause the source
                         and target to be atomically swapped.  Source and tar-
                         get need not be of the same type, i.e. it is possible
                         to swap a file with a directory.  EINVAL is returned
                         in case of bitwise-inclusive OR with RENAME_EXCL.

           RENAME_EXCL   On file systems that support it (see getattrlist(2)
                         VOL_CAP_INT_RENAME_EXCL), it will cause EEXIST to be
                         returned if the destination already exists. EINVAL is
                         returned in case of bitwise-inclusive OR with
                         RENAME_SWAP.

CCAAVVEEAATTSS
     The system can deadlock if a loop is present in the file system graph.
     This loop takes the form of an entry in directory `_a', say `_a_/_f_o_o', being
     a hard link to directory `_b', and an entry in directory `_b', say `_b_/_b_a_r',
     being a hard link to directory `_a'.  When such a loop exists and two sep-
     arate processes attempt to perform `rename a/foo b/bar' and `rename b/bar
     a/foo', respectively, the system may deadlock attempting to lock both
     directories for modification.

     Whether or not hard links to directories are supported is specific to the
     underlying filesystem implementation.

     It is recommended that any hard links to directories in an underlying
     filesystem should be replaced by symbolic links by the system administra-
     tor to avoid the possibility of deadlocks.

     Moving or renaming a file or directory into a directory with inheritable
     ACLs does not result in ACLs being set on the file or directory. Use
     acl(3) in conjunction with rreennaammee() to set ACLs on the file or directory.

EERRRROORRSS
     The rreennaammee() system call will fail and neither of the argument files will
     be affected if:

     [EACCES]           A component of either path prefix denies search per-
                        mission.

     [EACCES]           The requested operation requires writing in a direc-
                        tory (e.g., _n_e_w, new/.., or old/..) whose modes disal-
                        low this.

     [EDQUOT]           The directory in which the entry for the new name is
                        being placed cannot be extended because the user's
                        quota of disk blocks on the file system containing the
                        directory has been exhausted.

     [EEXIST]           _f_l_a_g_s has RENAME_EXCL set but _n_e_w already exists.

     [EFAULT]           _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated address
                        space.

     [EINVAL]           _O_l_d is a parent directory of _n_e_w, or an attempt is
                        made to rename `.' or `..'.  If RENAME_SWAP is used,
                        then EINVAL will also be returned if _n_e_w is a parent
                        directory of _o_l_d.  If both RENAME_SWAP and RENAME_EXCL
                        bits are set in _f_l_a_g_s, then EINVAL will be returned.

     [EINVAL]           _f_l_a_g_s has an invalid value.

     [EIO]              An I/O error occurs while making or updating a direc-
                        tory entry.

     [EISDIR]           _n_e_w is a directory, but _o_l_d is not a directory.

     [ELOOP]            Too many symbolic links are encountered in translating
                        either pathname.  This is taken to be indicative of a
                        looping symbolic link.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]     A component of a pathname exceeds {NAME_MAX} charac-
                        ters, or an entire path name exceeds {PATH_MAX} char-
                        acters.

     [ENOENT]           A component of the _o_l_d path does not exist, or a path
                        prefix of _n_e_w does not exist.

     [ENOENT]           _f_l_a_g_s has RENAME_SWAP set but _n_e_w does not exist.

     [ENOSPC]           The directory in which the entry for the new name is
                        being placed cannot be extended because there is no
                        space left on the file system containing the direc-
                        tory.

     [ENOTDIR]          A component of either path prefix is not a directory.

     [ENOTDIR]          _o_l_d is a directory, but _n_e_w is not a directory.

     [ENOTEMPTY]        _N_e_w is a directory and is not empty.

     [ENOTSUP]          _f_l_a_g_s has a value that is not supported by the file
                        system.

     [EPERM]            The directory containing _o_l_d is marked sticky, and
                        neither the containing directory nor _o_l_d are owned by
                        the effective user ID.

     [EPERM]            The _n_e_w file exists, the directory containing _n_e_w is
                        marked sticky, and neither the containing directory
                        nor _n_e_w are owned by the effective user ID.

     [EROFS]            The requested link requires writing in a directory on
                        a read-only file system.

     [EXDEV]            The link named by _n_e_w and the file named by _o_l_d are on
                        different logical devices (file systems).  Note that
                        this error code will not be returned if the implemen-
                        tation permits cross-device links.

     The rreennaammeeaatt() and rreennaammeeaattxx__nnpp() calls may also fail with:

     [EBADF]            The _f_r_o_m argument does not specify an absolute path
                        and the _f_r_o_m_f_d argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a
                        valid file descriptor open for searching, or the _t_o
                        argument does not specify an absolute path and the
                        _t_o_f_d argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file
                        descriptor open for searching.

     [ENOTDIR]          The _f_r_o_m argument is not an absolute path and _f_r_o_m_f_d
                        is neither AT_FDCWD nor a file descriptor associated
                        with a directory, or the _t_o argument is not an abso-
                        lute path and _t_o_f_d is neither AT_FDCWD nor a file
                        descriptor associated with a directory.

CCOONNFFOORRMMAANNCCEE
     The restriction on renaming a directory whose permissions disallow writ-
     ing is based on the fact that UFS directories contain a "".."" entry.  If
     renaming a directory would move it to another parent directory, this
     entry needs to be changed.

     This restriction has been generalized to disallow renaming of any write-
     disabled directory, even when this would not require a change to the ""..""
     entry.  For consistency, HFS+ directories emulate this behavior.

       speed up application startup when using the fontconfig library.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ggrreepp utility searches any given input files, selecting lines that
     match one or more patterns.  By default, a pattern matches an input line
     if the regular expression (RE) in the pattern matches the input line
     without its trailing newline.  An empty expression matches every line.
     Each input line that matches at least one of the patterns is written to
     the standard output.

     ggrreepp is used for simple patterns and basic regular expressions (BREs);
     eeggrreepp can handle extended regular expressions (EREs).  See re_format(7)
     for more information on regular expressions.  ffggrreepp is quicker than both
     ggrreepp and eeggrreepp, but can only handle fixed patterns (i.e. it does not
     interpret regular expressions).  Patterns may consist of one or more
     lines, allowing any of the pattern lines to match a portion of the input.

     zzggrreepp, zzeeggrreepp, and zzffggrreepp act like ggrreepp, eeggrreepp, and ffggrreepp, respectively,
     but accept input files compressed with the compress(1) or gzip(1) com-
     pression utilities.

     The following options are available:

     --AA _n_u_m, ----aafftteerr--ccoonntteexxtt=_n_u_m
             Print _n_u_m lines of trailing context after each match.  See also
             the --BB and --CC options.

     --aa, ----tteexxtt
             Treat all files as ASCII text.  Normally ggrreepp will simply print
             ``Binary file ... matches'' if files contain binary characters.
             Use of this option forces ggrreepp to output lines matching the spec-
             ified pattern.

     --BB _n_u_m, ----bbeeffoorree--ccoonntteexxtt=_n_u_m
             Print _n_u_m lines of leading context before each match.  See also
             the --AA and --CC options.

     --bb, ----bbyyttee--ooffffsseett
             The offset in bytes of a matched pattern is displayed in front of
             the respective matched line.

     --CC[_n_u_m, ----ccoonntteexxtt=_n_u_m]
             Print _n_u_m lines of leading and trailing context surrounding each
             match.  The default is 2 and is equivalent to --AA _2 --BB _2.  Note:
             no whitespace may be given between the option and its argument.

     --cc, ----ccoouunntt
             Only a count of selected lines is written to standard output.

     ----ccoolloouurr=[_w_h_e_n, ----ccoolloorr=[_w_h_e_n]]
             Mark up the matching text with the expression stored in
             GREP_COLOR environment variable.  The possible values of when can
             be `never', `always' or `auto'.

     --DD _a_c_t_i_o_n, ----ddeevviicceess=_a_c_t_i_o_n
             Specify the demanded action for devices, FIFOs and sockets.  The
             default action is `read', which means, that they are read as if
             they were normal files.  If the action is set to `skip', devices
             will be silently skipped.

     --dd _a_c_t_i_o_n, ----ddiirreeccttoorriieess=_a_c_t_i_o_n
             Specify the demanded action for directories.  It is `read' by
             default, which means that the directories are read in the same
             manner as normal files.  Other possible values are `skip' to
             silently ignore the directories, and `recurse' to read them
             recursively, which has the same effect as the --RR and --rr option.

     --EE, ----eexxtteennddeedd--rreeggeexxpp
             Interpret _p_a_t_t_e_r_n as an extended regular expression (i.e. force
             ggrreepp to behave as eeggrreepp).

     --ee _p_a_t_t_e_r_n, ----rreeggeexxpp=_p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             Specify a pattern used during the search of the input: an input
             line is selected if it matches any of the specified patterns.
             This option is most useful when multiple --ee options are used to
             specify multiple patterns, or when a pattern begins with a dash
             (`-').

     ----eexxcclluuddee
             If specified, it excludes files matching the given filename pat-
             tern from the search.  Note that ----eexxcclluuddee patterns take priority
             over ----iinncclluuddee patterns, and if no ----iinncclluuddee pattern is speci-
             fied, all files are searched that are not excluded.  Patterns are
             matched to the full path specified, not only to the filename com-
             ponent.

     ----eexxcclluuddee--ddiirr
             If --RR is specified, it excludes directories matching the given
             filename pattern from the search.  Note that ----eexxcclluuddee--ddiirr pat-
             terns take priority over ----iinncclluuddee--ddiirr patterns, and if no
             ----iinncclluuddee--ddiirr pattern is specified, all directories are searched
             that are not excluded.

     --FF, ----ffiixxeedd--ssttrriinnggss
             Interpret _p_a_t_t_e_r_n as a set of fixed strings (i.e. force ggrreepp to
             behave as ffggrreepp).

     --ff _f_i_l_e, ----ffiillee=_f_i_l_e
             Read one or more newline separated patterns from _f_i_l_e.  Empty
             pattern lines match every input line.  Newlines are not consid-
             ered part of a pattern.  If _f_i_l_e is empty, nothing is matched.

     --GG, ----bbaassiicc--rreeggeexxpp
             Interpret _p_a_t_t_e_r_n as a basic regular expression (i.e. force ggrreepp
             to behave as traditional ggrreepp).

     --HH      Always print filename headers with output lines.

     --hh, ----nnoo--ffiilleennaammee
             Never print filename headers (i.e. filenames) with output lines.

     ----hheellpp  Print a brief help message.

     --II      Ignore binary files.  This option is equivalent to

             sitive.

     ----iinncclluuddee
             If specified, only files matching the given filename pattern are

             fied, not only to the filename component.

     ----iinncclluuddee--ddiirr

     --ll, ----ffiilleess--wwiitthh--mmaattcchheess
             Only the names of files containing selected lines are written to
             standard output.  ggrreepp will only search a file until a match has
             been found, making searches potentially less expensive.  Path-
             names are listed once per file searched.  If the standard input
             is searched, the string ``(standard input)'' is written.

     ----mmmmaapp  Use mmap(2) instead of read(2) to read input, which can result in
             better performance under some circumstances but can cause unde-

     --mm _n_u_m_, ----mmaaxx--ccoouunntt=_n_u_m

     --nn, ----lliinnee--nnuummbbeerr
             Each output line is preceded by its relative line number in the
             file, starting at line 1.  The line number counter is reset for
             each file processed.  This option is ignored if --cc, --LL, --ll, or --qq
             is specified.

     ----nnuullll  Prints a zero-byte after the file name.

     --OO      If --RR is specified, follow symbolic links only if they were
             explicitly listed on the command line.  The default is not to

             Quiet mode: suppress normal output.  ggrreepp will only search a file

             _b_i_n_a_r_y, the default: search binary files but do not print them;
             _w_i_t_h_o_u_t_-_m_a_t_c_h: do not search binary files; and _t_e_x_t: treat all

     To find all occurrences of the pattern `.Pp' at the beginning of a line:

           $ grep '^\.Pp' myfile

     The apostrophes ensure the entire expression is evaluated by ggrreepp instead
     of by the user's shell.  The caret `^' matches the null string at the
     beginning of a line, and the `\' escapes the `.', which would otherwise
     match any character.

     `bar':

           $ grep -v -e 'foo' -e 'bar' myfile

     A simple example of an extended regular expression:

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ccsspplliitt utility splits _f_i_l_e into pieces using the patterns _a_r_g_s.  If
     _f_i_l_e is a dash (`--'), ccsspplliitt reads from standard input.

     The options are as follows:

     --ff _p_r_e_f_i_x
             Give created files names beginning with _p_r_e_f_i_x.  The default is
             ``_x_x''.

     --kk      Do not remove output files if an error occurs or a HUP, INT or
             TERM signal is received.

     --nn _n_u_m_b_e_r
             Use _n_u_m_b_e_r of decimal digits after the _p_r_e_f_i_x to form the file
             name.  The default is 2.

     --ss      Do not write the size of each output file to standard output as
             it is created.

     The _a_r_g_s operands may be a combination of the following patterns:

     //_r_e_g_e_x_p//[[++|--]_o_f_f_s_e_t]
             Create a file containing the input from the current line to (but
             not including) the next line matching the given basic regular
             expression.  An optional _o_f_f_s_e_t from the line that matched may be
             specified.

     %%_r_e_g_e_x_p%%[[++|--]_o_f_f_s_e_t]
             Same as above but a file is not created for the output.

     _l_i_n_e___n_o
             Create containing the input from the current line to (but not
             including) the specified line number.

     {{_n_u_m}}   Repeat the previous pattern the specified number of times.  If it
             follows a line number pattern, a new file will be created for
             each _l_i_n_e___n_o lines, _n_u_m times.  The first line of the file is
             line number 1 for historic reasons.

     After all the patterns have been processed, the remaining input data (if
     there is any) will be written to a new file.

     Requesting to split at a line before the current line number or past the
     end of the file will result in an error.

     In order for the BIOS to boot the kernel, certain conventions must be
     adhered to.  Sector 0 of a bootable hard disk must contain boot code, an
     MBR partition table, and a magic number (0xAA55).  These MBR partitions
     (also known as BIOS partitions) can be used to break the disk up into
     several pieces.

     The BIOS loads sector 0 of the boot disk into memory, verifies the magic
     number, and begins executing the code at the first byte.  The normal DOS
     MBR boot code searches the MBR partition table for an ``active'' parti-
     tion (indicated by a `*' in the first column), and if one is found, the
     boot block from that partition is loaded and executed in place of the
     original (MBR) boot block.

     The options are as follows:

     --ii      Initialize the MBR sector.

     --aa _s_t_y_l_e
             Specify an automatic partitioning style.

     --ee      Edit existing MBR sectors.

     --ff _m_b_r_n_a_m_e
             Specifies an alternate MBR template file.

     --uu      Update MBR code, preserving existing partition table.

     --yy      Do not ask for confirmation before writing.

     --dd      Dump partition table in a format readable by the -r option.

     --rr      Read a partition table from the standard input.

     --tt      Test if the disk is partitioned.

     --cc _c_y_l_i_n_d_e_r_s, --hh _h_e_a_d_s, --ss _s_e_c_t_o_r_s
             Specifies an alternate BIOS geometry for ffddiisskk to use.

     --SS _s_i_z_e
             Specify the disk size in blocks.

     --bb _s_i_z_e
             Specify the number of bytes per disk block.

     The DOS ffddiisskk program can be used to divide space on the disk into parti-
     tions and set one active.  This ffddiisskk program serves a similar purpose to
     the DOS program.  When called with no special flags, it prints the MBR
     partition table of the specified device, i.e.,

         # fdisk fd0
         Disk: fd0       geometry: 80/2/18 [2880 sectors]
         Offset: 0       Signature: 0xAA55
                  Starting        Ending
          #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]
         ----------------------------------------------------------------------
         *1: A6    0   0   1 -   79   1  18 [         0 -       2880] OpenBSD
          2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused
          3: A7    0   0   2 -   79   1  18 [         1 -       2879] NEXTSTEP
          4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused

     The geometry displayed is a synthetic geometry unless another geometry
     has been selected using the --cc, --hh, --ss, --SS, and --bb options.  In the
     future, ffddiisskk will read the BIOS geometry from the IOKit registry.

     In this example, the disk is divided into two partitions that happen to
     fill the disk.  The first partition overlaps the third partition.  (Used
     for debugging purposes.)

     _#           Number of partition table entry.  A ``*'' denotes the
                 bootable partition.

     _i_d          System identifier.  OpenBSD reserves the magic number 166
                 decimal (A6 in hex).  If no 166 partition is found, it will
                 use an older FreeBSD partition (with a magic number of 165 or
                 A5 in hex).

     _c_y_l_/_h_d_/_s_e_c  These fields provide the starting and ending address of the
                 partition in BIOS geometry

     _s_t_a_r_t_/_s_i_z_e  These fields provide the starting sector and size in sectors
                 of the partition in linear block addresses.

     _N_O_T_E: The sectors field is ``1 based'', and the start field is ``0
     based''.  The CHS values may need to be in the BIOS's geometry for older
     systems to be able to boot and use the drive correctly; most modern sys-
     tems prefer the starting sector and size in preference to the CHS values.

     The --ii flag is used to indicate that the partition data is to be initial-
     ized.  In this mode, ffddiisskk will completely overwrite the primary MBR and
     partition table, either using the default MBR template, or the one speci-
     fied by the --ff flag.

     In the default template, partition number 1 will be configured as a Dar-
     win boot partition spanning from cylinder 0, head 1, sector 1, and
     extending for 8 megabytes.  Partition number 2 will be configured as a
     Darwin HFS partition spanning the rest of the disk.  This mode is
     designed to initialize an MBR the very first time, or when it has been
     corrupted beyond repair.

     You can specify other default partition styles with the --aa flag.  The
     available styles are:

     _b_o_o_t_h_f_s     Creates an 8Mb boot partition (type AB hex) and makes the
                 rest of the disk a Darwin HFS partition (type AF hex).

     _h_f_s         Makes the entire disk one HFS+ partition (type AF hex).

     _d_o_s         Makes the entire disk one DOS partition (type 0C hex).

     _r_a_i_d        Makes the entire disk one type AC hex partition.

     The --uu flag is used to update the MBR code on a given drive.  The MBR
     code extends from offset 0x000 to the start of the partition table at
     offset 0x1BE.  It is similar to the --ii flag, except the existing parti-
     tion table is preserved. This is useful for writing new MBR code onto an
     existing drive, and is equivalent to the DOS command ``FDISK /MBR''.
     Note that this option will overwrite the NT disk signature, if present.
     The --uu and --ii flags may not be specified together.

     The flag --ee is used to modify a partition table using a interactive edit
     mode of the ffddiisskk program.  This mode is designed to allow you to change
     any partition on the drive you choose, including extended partitions.  It
     is a very powerful mode, but is safe as long as you do not execute the
     _w_r_i_t_e command, or answer in the negative (the default) when ffddiisskk asks
     you about writing out changes.

     When you first enter this mode, you are presented with a prompt, that
     looks like so: _f_d_i_s_k_: _0_>.  This prompt has two important pieces of infor-
     mation for you.  It will tell you if the in-memory copy of the boot block
     has been modified or not.  If it has been modified, the prompt will
     change to look like: _f_d_i_s_k_:_*_0_>.  The second piece of information pertains
     to the number given in the prompt.  This number specifies the disk offset
     of the currently selected boot block you are editing.  This number could
     be something different that zero when you are editing extended parti-
     tions.  The list of commands and their explanations are given below.

             tive edit mode.

     _r_e_i_n_i_t  Initialize the currently selected, in-memory copy of the boot
             block.

     _a_u_t_o    Partition the disk with one of the automatic partition styles.

     _d_i_s_k    Display the current drive geometry that ffddiisskk has probed.  You
             are given a chance to edit it if you wish.

     _e_d_i_t    Edit a given table entry in the memory copy of the current boot
             block.  You may edit either in BIOS geometry mode, or in sector
             offsets and sizes.

     _s_e_t_p_i_d  Change the partition identifier of the given partition table
             entry.  This command is particularly useful for reassigning an
             existing partition to OpenBSD.

     _f_l_a_g    Make the given partition table entry bootable.  Only one entry
             can be marked bootable.  If you wish to boot from an extended
             partition, you will need to mark the partition table entry for
             the extended partition as bootable.

     _u_p_d_a_t_e  Update the machine code in the memory copy of the currently
             selected boot block.  Note that this option will overwrite the NT
             disk signature, if present.

     _s_e_l_e_c_t  Select and load into memory the boot block pointed to by the
             extended partition table entry in the current boot block.

     _p_r_i_n_t   Print the currently selected in-memory copy of the boot block and
             its MBR table to the terminal.

     _w_r_i_t_e   Write the in-memory copy of the boot block to disk.  You will be
             asked to confirm this operation.

     _e_x_i_t    Exit the current level of ffddiisskk, either returning to the previ-
             ously selected in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the
             program if there is none.

     _q_u_i_t    Exit the current level of ffddiisskk, either returning to the previ-
             ously selected in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the
             program if there is none.  Unlike _e_x_i_t it does write the modified
             block out.

     _a_b_o_r_t   Quit program without saving current changes.

NNOOTTEESS
     The automatic calculation of starting cylinder etc. uses a set of figures
     that represent what the BIOS thinks is the geometry of the drive.  These
     figures are by default taken from the in-core disklabel, or values that
     _/_b_o_o_t has passed to the kernel, but ffddiisskk gives you an opportunity to
     change them if there is a need to.  This allows the user to create a
     bootblock that can work with drives that use geometry translation under a
     potentially different BIOS.

     If you hand craft your disk layout, please make sure that the OpenBSD
     partition starts on a cylinder boundary.  (This restriction may be
     changed in the future.)

     Editing an existing partition is risky, and may cause you to lose all the
     data in that partition.

     You should run this program interactively once or twice to see how it
     works.  This is completely safe as long as you answer the ``write'' ques-
     tions in the negative.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     EEddqquuoottaa is a quota editor.  By default, or if the --uu flag is specified,
     one or more users may be specified on the command line.  For each user a
     temporary file is created with an ASCII representation of the current
     disk quotas for that user.  The list of filesystems with user quotas is
     determined by scanning the mounted filesystems for a _._q_u_o_t_a_._o_p_s_._u_s_e_r file
     located at its root.  An editor is invoked on the ASCII file.  The editor
     invoked is vi(1) unless the environment variable EDITOR specifies other-
     wise.

     The quotas may then be modified, new quotas added, etc.  Setting a quota
     to zero indicates that no quota should be imposed.  Setting a hard limit
     to one indicates that no allocations should be permitted.  Setting a soft
     limit to one with a hard limit of zero indicates that allocations should
     be permitted on only a temporary basis (see --tt below).  The current usage
     information in the file is for informational purposes; only the hard and
     soft limits can be changed.

     On leaving the editor, eeddqquuoottaa reads the temporary file and modifies the
     binary quota files to reflect the changes made.  The binary quota file,
     _._q_u_o_t_a_._u_s_e_r is stored at the root of the filesystem.  The default file-
     name and root location for the user quotas cannot be overridden.

     If the --pp flag is specified, eeddqquuoottaa will duplicate the quotas of the
     prototypical user specified for each user specified.  This is the normal
     mechanism used to initialize quotas for groups of users.

     If the --gg flag is specified, eeddqquuoottaa is invoked to edit the quotas of one
     or more groups specified on the command line.  The list of filesystems
     with group quotas is determined by scanning the mounted filesystems for a
     _._q_u_o_t_a_._o_p_s_._g_r_o_u_p file located at its root.  Similarly, the binary quota
     file, _._q_u_o_t_a_._g_r_o_u_p is stored at the root of the filesystem.  The default
     filename and root location for group quotas cannot be overridden.  The --pp
     flag can be specified in conjunction with the --gg flag to specify a proto-
     typical group to be duplicated among the listed set of groups.

     Users are permitted to exceed their soft limits for a grace period that
     may be specified per filesystem.  Once the grace period has expired, the
     soft limit is enforced as a hard limit.  The default grace period for a
     filesystem is specified in _/_u_s_r_/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e_/_s_y_s_/_q_u_o_t_a_._h.  The --tt flag can be
     used to change the grace period.  By default, or when invoked with the --uu
     flag, the grace period is set for each filesystem with a _._q_u_o_t_a_._o_p_s_._u_s_e_r
     file located at its root.  When invoked with the --gg flag, the grace
     period is set for each filesystem with a _._q_u_o_t_a_._o_p_s_._g_r_o_u_p file located at
     its root.  The grace period may be specified in days, hours, minutes, or
     seconds.  Setting a grace period to zero indicates that the default grace
     period should be imposed.  Setting a grace period to one second indicates
     that no grace period should be granted.

     Only the super-user may edit quotas.

     Each of the following quota files is located at the root of the mounted
     filesystem.  The mount option files are empty files whose existence indi-
     cates that quotas are to be enabled for that filesystem.  The binary data

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

       expect - programmed dialogue with interactive programs, Version 5

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       eexxppeecctt [ --ddDDiinnNN ] [ --cc _c_m_d_s ] [ [ --[ff|bb] ] _c_m_d_f_i_l_e ] [ _a_r_g_s ]

IINNTTRROODDUUCCTTIIOONN
       EExxppeecctt  is a program that ""talks"" to other interactive programs accord-
       ing to a script.  Following  the  script,  EExxppeecctt  knows  what  can  be
       expected  from  a  program and what the correct response should be.  An
       interpreted language provides branching and high-level  control  struc-
       tures  to  direct the dialogue.  In addition, the user can take control
       and interact directly when desired, afterward returning control to  the
       script.

       EExxppeeccttkk is a mixture of EExxppeecctt and TTkk.  It behaves just like EExxppeecctt and
       TTkk's wwiisshh.  EExxppeecctt can also be used directly in  C  or  C++  (that  is,
       without Tcl).  See libexpect(3).

       The name ""Expect"" comes from the idea of _s_e_n_d_/_e_x_p_e_c_t sequences popular-
       ized by uucp, kermit and other modem control programs.  However  unlike
       uucp,  EExxppeecctt is generalized so that it can be run as a user-level com-
       mand with any program and task in mind.  EExxppeecctt can  actually  talk  to
       several programs at the same time.

       For example, here are some things EExxppeecctt can do:

              +o   Cause  your computer to dial you back, so that you can login
                  without paying for the call.

              +o   Start a game (e.g., rogue) and if the optimal  configuration
                  doesn't  appear, restart it (again and again) until it does,
                  then hand over control to you.

              +o   Run fsck, and in response to its  questions,  answer  ""yes"",
                  ""no""  or  give  control  back to you, based on predetermined
                  criteria.

              +o   Connect to another network or  BBS  (e.g.,  MCI  Mail,  Com-
                  puServe)  and  automatically  retrieve  your mail so that it
                  appears as if it was originally sent to your local system.

              +o   Carry environment variables, current directory, or any  kind
                  of information across rlogin, telnet, tip, su, chgrp, etc.

       There  are  a  variety  of  reasons  why the shell cannot perform these
       tasks.  (Try, you'll see.)  All are possible with EExxppeecctt.

       In general, EExxppeecctt is useful for running  any  program  which  requires
       interaction between the program and the user.  All that is necessary is
       that the interaction can be characterized programmatically.  EExxppeecctt can
       also give the user back control (without halting the program being con-
       trolled) if desired.  Similarly, the user can  return  control  to  the
       script at any time.

UUSSAAGGEE
       EExxppeecctt  reads  _c_m_d_f_i_l_e  for  a list of commands to execute.  EExxppeecctt may
       also be invoked implicitly on systems which support the #! notation  by
       marking  the  script  executable,  and  making  the  first line in your
       script:

           #!/usr/local/bin/expect -f

       Of course, the  path  must  accurately  describe  where  EExxppeecctt  lives.
       /usr/local/bin is just an example.

       The --cc flag prefaces a command to be executed before any in the script.
       The command should be quoted to prevent being broken up by  the  shell.
       This  option may be used multiple times.  Multiple commands may be exe-
       cuted with a single --cc by separating them  with  semicolons.   Commands
       are  executed  in  the  order  they  appear.  (When using Expectk, this
       option is specified as --ccoommmmaanndd.)

       The --dd flag enables some diagnostic  output,  which  primarily  reports
       internal  activity  of commands such as eexxppeecctt and iinntteerraacctt.  This flag
       has the same effect as ""exp_internal 1"" at the beginning of  an  Expect
       script,  plus the version of EExxppeecctt is printed.  (The ssttrraaccee command is
       useful for tracing statements, and the  ttrraaccee  command  is  useful  for
       tracing  variable  assignments.)   (When  using Expectk, this option is
       specified as --ddiiaagg.)

       The --DD flag enables an interactive debugger.  An integer  value  should
       follow.   The  debugger will take control before the next Tcl procedure
       if the value is non-zero or if a ^C is pressed (or a breakpoint is hit,
       or  other appropriate debugger command appears in the script).  See the
       README file or SEE ALSO (below) for more information on  the  debugger.
       (When using Expectk, this option is specified as --DDeebbuugg.)

       The --ff flag prefaces a file from which to read commands from.  The flag
       itself is optional as it is only useful when using the #! notation (see
       above),  so  that  other arguments may be supplied on the command line.
       (When using Expectk, this option is specified as --ffiillee.)

       By default, the command file is read into memory and  executed  in  its
       entirety.   It  is  occasionally  desirable to read files one line at a
       time.  For example, stdin is read this way.  In order  to  force  arbi-
       trary  files  to  be  handled  this  way, use the --bb flag.  (When using
       Expectk, this option is specified as  --bbuuffffeerr.)NNootteethatssttddiioo--bbuuffffeerriinngg--
       mayssttiilllltakeppllaacceehowevertthhiissshouldn'tccaauusseeproblemswwhheennreadingffrroommaffii--
       ffooorssttddiinn..

       If the string ""-"" is supplied as a filename,  standard  input  is  read
       instead.  (Use ""./-"" to read from a file actually named ""-"".)

       The  --ii flag causes EExxppeecctt to interactively prompt for commands instead
       of reading them from a file.  Prompting is terminated via the eexxiitt com-
       mand or upon EOF.  See iinntteerrpprreetteerr (below) for more information.  --ii is
       assumed if neither a command file nor --cc is used.  (When using Expectk,
       this option is specified as --iinntteerraaccttiivvee.)

       ----  may  be  used to delimit the end of the options.  This is useful if
       you want to pass an option-like argument  to  your  script  without  it
       being  interpreted  by  EExxppeecctt.   This can usefully be placed in the #!
       line to prevent any flag-like interpretation by Expect.   For  example,
       the  following  will leave the original arguments (including the script
       name) in the variable _a_r_g_v.

           #!/usr/local/bin/expect --

       Note that  the  usual  getopt(3)  and  execve(2)  conventions  must  be
       observed when adding arguments to the #! line.

       The  file  $exp_library/expect.rc  is sourced automatically if present,
       unless the --NN flag is used.  (When using Expectk, this option is speci-
       fied  as  --NNOORRCC.)   Immediately  after  this,  the file ~/.expect.rc is
       sourced automatically, unless the --nn flag is used.  If the  environment
       variable DOTDIR is defined, it is treated as a directory and .expect.rc
       is read from there.  (When using Expectk, this option is  specified  as
       --nnoorrcc.)  This sourcing occurs only after executing any --cc flags.

       --vv  causes  Expect  to  print its version number and exit.  (The corre-
       sponding flag in Expectk, which uses long flag names, is -version.)

       Optional _a_r_g_s are constructed into a list and stored  in  the  variable
       named _a_r_g_v.  _a_r_g_c is initialized to the length of argv.

       _a_r_g_v_0  is  defined to be the name of the script (or binary if no script
       is used).  For example, the following prints out the name of the script
       and the first three arguments:

           send_user ""$argv0 [lrange $argv 0 2]\n""


CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
       EExxppeecctt  uses  _T_c_l  (Tool  Command Language).  Tcl provides control flow
       (e.g., if, for, break), expression evaluation and  several  other  fea-
       tures such as recursion, procedure definition, etc.  Commands used here
       but not defined (e.g., sseett, iiff, eexxeecc) are Tcl  commands  (see  tcl(3)).
       EExxppeecctt supports additional commands, described below.  Unless otherwise
       specified, commands return the empty string.

       Commands are listed alphabetically so that they can be quickly located.
       However,  new users may find it easier to start by reading the descrip-
       tions of ssppaawwnn, sseenndd, eexxppeecctt, and iinntteerraacctt, in that order.

       Note that the best introduction to the language (both Expect  and  Tcl)
       is provided in the book ""Exploring Expect"" (see SEE ALSO below).  Exam-
       ples are included in this man page but they are very limited since this
       man page is meant primarily as reference material.

       Note  that in the text of this man page, ""Expect"" with an uppercase ""E""
       refers to the EExxppeecctt program  while  ""expect""  with  a  lower-case  ""e""
       refers to the eexxppeecctt command within the EExxppeecctt program.)

       cclloossee _[_-_s_l_a_v_e_] _[_-_o_n_e_x_e_c _0_|_1_] _[_-_i _s_p_a_w_n___i_d_]
             closes  the  connection to the current process.  Most interactive
             programs will detect EOF on their stdin and exit; thus cclloossee usu-
             ally  suffices to kill the process as well.  The --ii flag declares
             the process to close corresponding to the named spawn_id.

             Both eexxppeecctt and iinntteerraacctt will detect  when  the  current  process
             exits and implicitly do a cclloossee.  But if you kill the process by,
             say, ""exec kill $pid"", you will need to explicitly call cclloossee.

             The --oonneexxeecc flag determines whether the spawn id will  be  closed
             in  any new spawned processes or if the process is overlayed.  To
             leave a spawn id open, use the value 0.  A non-zero integer value
             will force the spawn closed (the default) in any new processes.

             The  --ssllaavvee  flag  closes the slave associated with the spawn id.
             (See ""spawn -pty"".)  When the connection is closed, the slave  is
             automatically closed as well if still open.

             No  matter whether the connection is closed implicitly or explic-
             itly, you should call wwaaiitt to clear up the  corresponding  kernel
             process slot.  cclloossee does not call wwaaiitt since there is no guaran-
             tee that closing a process connection will cause it to exit.  See

             controls  a Tcl debugger allowing you to step through statements,
             set breakpoints, etc.

             With no arguments, a 1 is returned if the debugger  is  not  run-
             ning, otherwise a 0 is returned.

             With  a  1 argument, the debugger is started.  With a 0 argument,
             the debugger is stopped.  If a 1 argument is preceded by the --nnooww
             flag, the debugger is started immediately (i.e., in the middle of
             the ddeebbuugg command itself).  Otherwise, the  debugger  is  started
             with the next Tcl statement.

             The  ddeebbuugg  command  does  not change any traps.  Compare this to
             starting Expect with the --DD flag (see above).

             See the README file or SEE ALSO (below) for more  information  on
             the debugger.

       ddiissccoonnnneecctt
             disconnects  a  forked  process  from the terminal.  It continues
             running in the background.  The process is given its own  process
             group (if possible).  Standard I/O is redirected to /dev/null.

             The  following  fragment  uses ddiissccoonnnneecctt to continue running the
             script in the background.

                 if {[fork]!=0} exit
                 disconnect
                 . . .

             The following script reads a password, and then  runs  a  program
             every  hour  that  demands  a  password each time it is run.  The
             script supplies the password so that you only  have  to  type  it
             once.   (See  the ssttttyy command which demonstrates how to turn off
             password echoing.)

                 send_user ""password?\ ""
                 expect_user -re ""(.*)\n""
                 for {} 1 {} {
                     if {[fork]!=0} {sleep 3600;continue}
                     disconnect
                     spawn priv_prog
                     expect Password:
                     send ""$expect_out(1,string)\r""
                     . . .
                     exit
                 }

             An advantage to using  ddiissccoonnnneecctt  over  the  shell  asynchronous
             process  feature (&) is that EExxppeecctt can save the terminal parame-
             ters prior to disconnection, and then later  apply  them  to  new
             ptys.   With  &, EExxppeecctt does not have a chance to read the termi-
             nal's parameters since the terminal is  already  disconnected  by
             the time EExxppeecctt receives control.

       eexxiitt _[_-_o_p_t_s_] _[_s_t_a_t_u_s_]
             causes EExxppeecctt to exit or otherwise prepare to do so.

             The  --oonneexxiitt  flag causes the next argument to be used as an exit
             handler.  Without  an  argument,  the  current  exit  handler  is
             returned.

             The  --nnooeexxiitt flag causes EExxppeecctt to prepare to exit but stop short
             of actually returning control to the operating system.  The user-
             defined exit handler is run as well as Expect's own internal han-
             dlers.  No further Expect commands should be executed.   This  is
             useful  if you are running Expect with other Tcl extensions.  The
             current interpreter (and main window if in  the  Tk  environment)
             remain  so  that  other Tcl extensions can clean up.  If Expect's
             eexxiitt is called again (however this might occur), the handlers are
             not rerun.

             Upon  exiting,  all  connections to spawned processes are closed.
             Closure will be detected as an EOF by  spawned  processes.   eexxiitt
             takes  no other actions beyond what the normal _exit(2) procedure
             does.  Thus, spawned processes that do not check for EOF may con-
             tinue  to  run.  (A variety of conditions are important to deter-
             mining, for example, what signals a spawned process will be sent,
             but   these  are  system-dependent,  typically  documented  under
             exit(3).)  Spawned processes that continue to run will be  inher-
             ited by init.

             _s_t_a_t_u_s  (or 0 if not specified) is returned as the exit status of
             EExxppeecctt.  eexxiitt is implicitly executed if the end of the script  is
             reached.

       eexxpp__ccoonnttiinnuuee [-continue_timer]
             The command eexxpp__ccoonnttiinnuuee allows eexxppeecctt itself to continue execut-
             ing rather than  returning  as  it  normally  would.  By  default
             eexxpp__ccoonnttiinnuuee  resets  the timeout timer. The _-_c_o_n_t_i_n_u_e___t_i_m_e_r flag
             prevents timer from being restarted. (See eexxppeecctt for more  infor-
             mation.)

       eexxpp__iinntteerrnnaall _[_-_f _f_i_l_e_] _v_a_l_u_e
             causes  further  commands to send diagnostic information internal
             to EExxppeecctt to stderr if _v_a_l_u_e is non-zero.  This  output  is  dis-
             abled  if  _v_a_l_u_e is 0.  The diagnostic information includes every
             character received, and every attempt made to match  the  current
             output against the patterns.

             If the optional _f_i_l_e is supplied, all normal and debugging output
             is written to that file (regardless of the value of _v_a_l_u_e).   Any
             previous diagnostic output file is closed.

             The --iinnffoo flag causes exp_internal to return a description of the
             most recent non-info arguments given.

       eexxpp__ooppeenn _[_a_r_g_s_] _[_-_i _s_p_a_w_n___i_d_]
             returns a Tcl file identifier that corresponds  to  the  original
             spawn  id.   The  file  identifier can then be used as if it were
             opened by Tcl's ooppeenn command.  (The spawn id should no longer  be
             used.  A wwaaiitt should not be executed.

             The  --lleeaavveeooppeenn  flag leaves the spawn id open for access through
             Expect commands.  A wwaaiitt must be executed on the spawn id.

       eexxpp__ppiidd _[_-_i _s_p_a_w_n___i_d_]
             returns the process id corresponding  to  the  currently  spawned
             process.  If the --ii flag is used, the pid returned corresponds to
             that of the given spawn id.

       eexxpp__sseenndd
             is an alias for sseenndd.

       eexxpp__sseenndd__eerrrroorr
             is an alias for sseenndd__eerrrroorr.

       eexxpp__sseenndd__lloogg
             is an alias for sseenndd__lloogg.

       eexxpp__sseenndd__ttttyy
             is an alias for sseenndd__ttttyy.

       eexxpp__sseenndd__uusseerr
             is an alias for sseenndd__uusseerr.

       eexxpp__vveerrssiioonn _[_[_-_e_x_i_t_] _v_e_r_s_i_o_n_]
             is useful for assuring that the script  is  compatible  with  the
             current version of Expect.

             With  no  arguments,  the  current version of EExxppeecctt is returned.
             This version may then be encoded in your script.  If you actually
             know  that you are not using features of recent versions, you can
             specify an earlier version.

             Versions consist of three numbers separated by  dots.   First  is
             the  major number.  Scripts written for versions of EExxppeecctt with a
             different major number will almost certainly not work.   eexxpp__vveerr--
             ssiioonn returns an error if the major numbers do not match.

             Second is the minor number.  Scripts written for a version with a
             greater minor number than the current  version  may  depend  upon
             some new feature and might not run.  eexxpp__vveerrssiioonn returns an error
             if the major numbers  match,  but  the  script  minor  number  is
             greater than that of the running EExxppeecctt.

             Third  is  a number that plays no part in the version comparison.
             However, it is incremented when the EExxppeecctt software  distribution
             is  changed  in  any  way, such as by additional documentation or
             optimization.  It is reset to 0 upon each new minor version.

             With the --eexxiitt flag, EExxppeecctt prints an error and exits if the ver-
             sion is out of date.

       eexxppeecctt _[_[_-_o_p_t_s_] _p_a_t_1 _b_o_d_y_1_] _._._. _[_-_o_p_t_s_] _p_a_t_n _[_b_o_d_y_n_]
             waits  until  one of the patterns matches the output of a spawned
             process, a specified time period has passed, or an end-of-file is
             seen.  If the final body is empty, it may be omitted.

             Patterns  from  the most recent eexxppeecctt__bbeeffoorree command are implic-
             itly used before any other  patterns.   Patterns  from  the  most
             recent  eexxppeecctt__aafftteerr  command are implicitly used after any other
             patterns.

             If the arguments to the entire eexxppeecctt statement require more than
             one  line,  all  the  arguments may be ""braced"" into one so as to
             avoid terminating each line with a backslash.  In this one  case,
             the usual Tcl substitutions will occur despite the braces.

             If  a  pattern is the keyword eeooff, the corresponding body is exe-
             cuted upon end-of-file.  If a pattern is the keyword ttiimmeeoouutt, the
             corresponding  body is executed upon timeout.  If no timeout key-
             word is used, an implicit null action is executed  upon  timeout.
             The  default  timeout  period  is  10 seconds but may be set, for
             example to 30, by the command  ""set  timeout  30"".   An  infinite
             timeout  may  be designated by the value -1.  If a pattern is the
             keyword ddeeffaauulltt, the corresponding body is executed  upon  either
             timeout or end-of-file.

             If  a  pattern  matches, then the corresponding body is executed.
             eexxppeecctt returns the result of the body (or the empty string if  no
             pattern matched).  In the event that multiple patterns match, the
             one appearing first is used to select a body.

             Each time new output arrives, it is compared to each  pattern  in
             the  order  they are listed.  Thus, you may test for absence of a
             match by making the last pattern something guaranteed to  appear,
             such  as  a  prompt.  In situations where there is no prompt, you
             must use ttiimmeeoouutt (just like you would  if  you  were  interacting
             manually).

             Patterns  are  specified in three ways.  By default, patterns are
             specified as with Tcl's ssttrriinngg mmaattcchh command.  (Such patterns are
             also  similar  to C-shell regular expressions usually referred to
             as ""glob"" patterns).  The --ggll flag may may  be  used  to  protect
             patterns  that  might otherwise match eexxppeecctt flags from doing so.
             Any pattern beginning with a ""-"" should be  protected  this  way.
             (All  strings starting with ""-"" are reserved for future options.)


             For example, the following fragment looks for a successful login.
             (Note  that aabboorrtt is presumed to be a procedure defined elsewhere
             in the script.)

                 expect {
                     busy               {puts busy\n ; exp_continue}
                     failed             abort
                     ""invalid password"" abort
                     timeout            abort
                     connected
                 }

             Quotes are necessary on the fourth pattern since  it  contains  a
             space,  which  would  otherwise  separate  the  pattern  from the
             action.  Patterns with the same action (such as the 3rd and  4th)
             require  listing  the  actions again.  This can be avoid by using
             regexp-style patterns (see below).  More information  on  forming
             glob-style patterns can be found in the Tcl manual.

             Regexp-style  patterns  follow the syntax defined by Tcl's rreeggeexxpp
             (short for ""regular expression"") command.   regexp  patterns  are
             introduced  with  the  flag  --rree.   The  previous  example can be
             rewritten using a regexp as:

                 expect {
                     busy       {puts busy\n ; exp_continue}
                     -re ""failed|invalid password"" abort
                     timeout    abort
                     connected
                 }

             Both types of patterns are ""unanchored"".  This  means  that  pat-
             terns  do  not have to match the entire string, but can begin and
             end the match anywhere in the string (as long as everything  else
             matches).   Use  ^  to  match the beginning of a string, and $ to
             match the end.  Note that if you do not wait for  the  end  of  a
             string,  your  responses  can  easily end up in the middle of the
             string as they are echoed from the spawned process.  While  still
             producing  correct results, the output can look unnatural.  Thus,
             use of $ is encouraged if you can exactly describe the characters
             at the end of a string.

             Note  that  in  many editors, the ^ and $ match the beginning and
             end of lines respectively. However, because expect  is  not  line
             oriented,  these  characters  match  the beginning and end of the
             data (as opposed to  lines)  currently  in  the  expect  matching
             buffer.  (Also, see the note below on ""system indigestion."")

             The  --eexx  flag  causes  the  pattern  to be matched as an ""exact""
             string.  No interpretation of *, ^, etc  is  made  (although  the
             usual  Tcl  conventions  must still be observed).  Exact patterns
             are always unanchored.


             The --nnooccaassee flag causes uppercase characters  of  the  output  to
             compare as if they were lowercase characters.  The pattern is not
             affected.

             While reading output, more than  2000  bytes  can  force  earlier
             bytes  to  be ""forgotten"".  This may be changed with the function
             mmaattcchh__mmaaxx.  (Note that excessively large values can slow down the
             pattern  matcher.)   If _p_a_t_l_i_s_t is ffuullll__bbuuffffeerr, the corresponding
             body is executed if _m_a_t_c_h___m_a_x bytes have  been  received  and  no
             other patterns have matched.  Whether or not the ffuullll__bbuuffffeerr key-
             word  is  used,  the  forgotten   characters   are   written   to
             expect_out(buffer).

             If  _p_a_t_l_i_s_t  is  the keyword nnuullll, and nulls are allowed (via the
             rreemmoovvee__nnuullllss command), the corresponding body is  executed  if  a
             single  ASCII  0 is matched.  It is not possible to match 0 bytes
             via glob or regexp patterns.

             Upon matching a pattern (or eof or full_buffer), any matching and
             previously   unmatched   output   is   saved   in   the  variable
             _e_x_p_e_c_t___o_u_t_(_b_u_f_f_e_r_).  Up to 9 regexp substring matches  are  saved
             in      the      variables      _e_x_p_e_c_t___o_u_t_(_1_,_s_t_r_i_n_g_)      through
             _e_x_p_e_c_t___o_u_t_(_9_,_s_t_r_i_n_g_).  If the --iinnddiicceess flag is used before a pat-
             tern,  the  starting  and  ending indices (in a form suitable for
             llrraannggee)  of  the  10  strings  are  stored   in   the   variables
             _e_x_p_e_c_t___o_u_t_(_X_,_s_t_a_r_t_)  and  _e_x_p_e_c_t___o_u_t_(_X_,_e_n_d_)  where  X is a digit,
             corresponds to the substring position in the buffer.  0 refers to
             strings  which  matched  the  entire pattern and is generated for
             glob patterns as well as regexp  patterns.   For  example,  if  a
             process has produced output of ""abcdefgh\n"", the result of:

                 expect ""cd""

             is as if the following statements had executed:

                 set expect_out(0,string) cd
                 set expect_out(buffer) abcd

             and ""efgh\n"" is left in the output buffer.  If a process produced
             the output ""abbbcabkkkka\n"", the result of:

                 expect -indices -re ""b(b*).*(k+)""

             is as if the following statements had executed:

                 set expect_out(0,start) 1
                 set expect_out(0,end) 10
                 set expect_out(0,string) bbbcabkkkk
                 set expect_out(1,start) 2
                 set expect_out(1,end) 3
                 set expect_out(1,string) bb
                 set expect_out(2,start) 10
                 set expect_out(2,end) 10
                 set expect_out(2,string) k
                 set expect_out(buffer) abbbcabkkkk

             and ""a\n"" is left in the output buffer.  The pattern ""*"" (and -re
             "".*"")  will flush the output buffer without reading any more out-
             put from the process.

             Normally, the matched output is discarded from Expect's  internal
             buffers.   This  may be prevented by prefixing a pattern with the
             --nnoottrraannssffeerr flag.  This flag is especially useful in  experiment-
             ing  (and  can  be  abbreviated  to  ""-not"" for convenience while
             experimenting).

             The spawn id associated with  the  matching  output  (or  eof  or
             full_buffer) is stored in _e_x_p_e_c_t___o_u_t_(_s_p_a_w_n___i_d_).

             The  --ttiimmeeoouutt  flag  causes the current expect command to use the
             following value as a timeout instead of using the  value  of  the
             timeout variable.

             By  default, patterns are matched against output from the current
             process, however the --ii flag declares the output from  the  named
             spawn_id  list  be  matched against any following patterns (up to
             the next --ii).  The spawn_id list should either  be  a  whitespace
             separated  list  of  spawn_ids  or a variable referring to such a
             list of spawn_ids.

             For example, the following example waits for ""connected"" from the
             current  process,  or ""busy"", ""failed"" or ""invalid password"" from
             the spawn_id named by $proc2.

                 expect {
                     -i $proc2 busy {puts busy\n ; exp_continue}
                     -re ""failed|invalid password"" abort
                     timeout abort
                     connected
                 }

             The value of the global variable  _a_n_y___s_p_a_w_n___i_d  may  be  used  to
             match  patterns to any spawn_ids that are named with all other --ii
             flags in the current eexxppeecctt command.  The spawn_id from a --ii flag
             with no associated pattern (i.e., followed immediately by another
             --ii) is made available to any other patterns in  the  same  eexxppeecctt
             command associated with _a_n_y___s_p_a_w_n___i_d_.

             The  --ii  flag  may  also name a global variable in which case the
             variable is read for a list of spawn ids.  The variable is reread
             whenever  it  changes.   This  provides a way of changing the I/O
             source while the command is in  execution.   Spawn  ids  provided
             this way are called ""indirect"" spawn ids.

             Actions  such  as  bbrreeaakk  and  ccoonnttiinnuuee  cause control structures
             (i.e., ffoorr, pprroocc) to  behave  in  the  usual  way.   The  command
             eexxpp__ccoonnttiinnuuee  allows  eexxppeecctt  itself to continue executing rather
             than returning as it normally would.

             This is useful for avoiding explicit  loops  or  repeated  expect
             statements.  The following example is part of a fragment to auto-
             mate rlogin.  The eexxpp__ccoonnttiinnuuee avoids having to  write  a  second
             eexxppeecctt  statement  (to  look  for the prompt again) if the rlogin
             prompts for a password.

                 expect {
                     Password: {
                         stty -echo
                         send_user ""password (for $user) on $host: ""
                         expect_user -re ""(.*)\n""
                         send_user ""\n""
                         send ""$expect_out(1,string)\r""
                         stty echo
                         exp_continue
                     } incorrect {
                         send_user ""invalid password or account\n""
                         exit
                     } timeout {
                         send_user ""connection to $host timed out\n""
                         exit
                     } eof {
                         send_user \
                             ""connection to host failed: $expect_out(buffer)""
                         exit
                     } -re $prompt
                 }

             For example, the following fragment might help a  user  guide  an
             interaction that is already totally automated.  In this case, the
             terminal is put into raw mode.  If the user presses ""+"", a  vari-
             able is incremented.  If ""p"" is pressed, several returns are sent
             to the process, perhaps to poke it in some way, and ""i"" lets  the
             user interact with the process, effectively stealing away control
             from the script.  In each case, the eexxpp__ccoonnttiinnuuee allows the  cur-
             rent eexxppeecctt to continue pattern matching after executing the cur-
             rent action.

                 stty raw -echo
                 expect_after {
                     -i $user_spawn_id
                     ""p"" {send ""\r\r\r""; exp_continue}
                     ""+"" {incr foo; exp_continue}
                     ""i"" {interact; exp_continue}
                     ""quit"" exit
                 }


             By default, eexxpp__ccoonnttiinnuuee resets the timeout timer.  The timer  is
             not restarted, if eexxpp__ccoonnttiinnuuee is called with the --ccoonnttiinnuuee__ttiimmeerr
             flag.

       eexxppeecctt__aafftteerr _[_e_x_p_e_c_t___a_r_g_s_]
             works identically to the eexxppeecctt__bbeeffoorree except  that  if  patterns
             from  both  eexxppeecctt and eexxppeecctt__aafftteerr can match, the eexxppeecctt pattern
             is used.  See the eexxppeecctt__bbeeffoorree command for more information.

       eexxppeecctt__bbaacckkggrroouunndd _[_e_x_p_e_c_t___a_r_g_s_]
             takes the same arguments as eexxppeecctt, however  it  returns  immedi-
             ately.  Patterns are tested whenever new input arrives.  The pat-
             tern ttiimmeeoouutt and ddeeffaauulltt are meaningless to eexxppeecctt__bbaacckkggrroouunndd and
             are silently discarded.  Otherwise, the eexxppeecctt__bbaacckkggrroouunndd command
             uses eexxppeecctt__bbeeffoorree and eexxppeecctt__aafftteerr  patterns  just  like  eexxppeecctt
             does.

             When  eexxppeecctt__bbaacckkggrroouunndd  actions  are being evaluated, background
             processing for the same spawn id is blocked.  Background process-
             ing  is  unblocked  when  the action completes.  While background
             processing is blocked, it is possible to do a (foreground) eexxppeecctt
             on the same spawn id.

             It  is  not  possible  to execute an eexxppeecctt while an eexxppeecctt__bbaacckk--
             ggrroouunndd is unblocked.  eexxppeecctt__bbaacckkggrroouunndd for a particular spawn id
             is  deleted  by  declaring  a new expect_background with the same
             spawn id.  Declaring eexxppeecctt__bbaacckkggrroouunndd with  no  pattern  removes
             the  given  spawn  id  from  the ability to match patterns in the
             background.

       eexxppeecctt__bbeeffoorree _[_e_x_p_e_c_t___a_r_g_s_]
             takes the same arguments as eexxppeecctt, however  it  returns  immedi-
             ately.   Pattern-action  pairs from the most recent eexxppeecctt__bbeeffoorree
             with the same spawn id are  implicitly  added  to  any  following
             eexxppeecctt  commands.   If  a pattern matches, it is treated as if it
             had been specified in the eexxppeecctt command itself, and the  associ-
             ated  body  is executed in the context of the eexxppeecctt command.  If
             patterns from  both  eexxppeecctt__bbeeffoorree  and  eexxppeecctt  can  match,  the
             eexxppeecctt__bbeeffoorree pattern is used.

             If  no  pattern is specified, the spawn id is not checked for any
             patterns.

             Unless overridden by a  --ii  flag,  eexxppeecctt__bbeeffoorree  patterns  match
             against  the  spawn id defined at the time that the eexxppeecctt__bbeeffoorree
             command was executed (not when its pattern is matched).

             The -info flag causes eexxppeecctt__bbeeffoorree to return the current  speci-
             fications of what patterns it will match.  By default, it reports
             on the current spawn id.  An optional spawn id specification  may
             be given for information on that spawn id.  For example

                 expect_before -info -i $proc

             At most one spawn id specification may be given.  The flag -indi-
             rect suppresses direct spawn ids that  come  only  from  indirect
             specifications.

             Instead  of  a spawn id specification, the flag ""-all"" will cause
             ""-info"" to report on all spawn ids.

             The output of the -info flag can be reused  as  the  argument  to
             expect_before.

       eexxppeecctt__ttttyy _[_e_x_p_e_c_t___a_r_g_s_]
             is  like  eexxppeecctt but it reads characters from /dev/tty (i.e. key-
             strokes from the user).  By  default,  reading  is  performed  in
             cooked  mode.   Thus,  lines  must end with a return in order for
             eexxppeecctt to see them.  This may be changed via ssttttyy (see  the  ssttttyy
             command below).

       eexxppeecctt__uusseerr _[_e_x_p_e_c_t___a_r_g_s_]
             is  like  eexxppeecctt  but  it  reads characters from stdin (i.e. key-
             strokes from the user).  By  default,  reading  is  performed  in
             cooked  mode.   Thus,  lines  must end with a return in order for
             eexxppeecctt to see them.  This may be changed via ssttttyy (see  the  ssttttyy
             command below).

       ffoorrkk  creates  a  new process.  The new process is an exact copy of the
             current EExxppeecctt process.  On success, ffoorrkk returns 0  to  the  new
             (child)  process  and returns the process ID of the child process
             to the parent process.  On failure (invariably  due  to  lack  of
             resources, e.g., swap space, memory), ffoorrkk returns -1 to the par-
             ent process, and no child process is created.

             Forked processes exit via the eexxiitt command, just like the  origi-
             nal  process.   Forked  processes are allowed to write to the log
             files.  If you do not disable debugging or logging in most of the
             processes, the result can be confusing.

             Some  pty implementations may be confused by multiple readers and
             writers, even momentarily.  Thus, it is  safest  to  ffoorrkk  before
             spawning processes.

       iinntteerraacctt _[_s_t_r_i_n_g_1 _b_o_d_y_1_] _._._. _[_s_t_r_i_n_g_n _[_b_o_d_y_n_]_]
             gives  control  of  the current process to the user, so that key-
             strokes are sent to the  current  process,  and  the  stdout  and
             stderr of the current process are returned.

             String-body  pairs  may  be specified as arguments, in which case
             the body is executed when the corresponding  string  is  entered.
             (By  default,  the  string  is  not sent to the current process.)
             The iinntteerrpprreetteerr command is assumed, if the final body is missing.

             If  the  arguments  to the entire iinntteerraacctt statement require more
             than one line, all the arguments may be ""braced"" into one  so  as
             to  avoid  terminating  each  line with a backslash.  In this one
             case, the usual Tcl substitutions will occur despite the  braces.

             For example, the following command runs interact with the follow-
             ing string-body pairs defined:  When ^Z  is  pressed,  EExxppeecctt  is
             suspended.   (The --rreesseett flag restores the terminal modes.)  When
             ^A is pressed, the user sees ""you  typed  a  control-A""  and  the
             process is sent a ^A.  When $ is pressed, the user sees the date.
             When ^C is pressed, EExxppeecctt exits.  If ""foo"" is entered, the  user
             sees  ""bar"".   When  ~~  is  pressed, the EExxppeecctt interpreter runs
             interactively.

                 set CTRLZ \032
                 interact {
                     -reset $CTRLZ {exec kill -STOP [pid]}
                     \001   {send_user ""you typed a control-A\n"";
                             send ""\001""
                            }
                     $      {send_user ""The date is [clock format [clock seconds]].""}
                     \003   exit
                     foo    {send_user ""bar""}
                     ~~
                 }


             In string-body pairs, strings are matched in the order  they  are
             listed  as  arguments.  Strings that partially match are not sent
             to the current process in anticipation of the  remainder  coming.
             If characters are then entered such that there can no longer pos-
             sibly be a match, only the part of the string will be sent to the
             process  that cannot possibly begin another match.  Thus, strings
             that are substrings of partial matches can match  later,  if  the
             original  strings  that  was  attempting  to  be match ultimately
             fails.

             By default, string matching is exact with  no  wild  cards.   (In
             contrast,   the   eexxppeecctt  command  uses  glob-style  patterns  by
             default.)  The --eexx flag may be  used  to  protect  patterns  that
             might  otherwise match iinntteerraacctt flags from doing so.  Any pattern
             beginning with a  ""-""  should  be  protected  this  way.     (All
             strings starting with ""-"" are reserved for future options.)

             The  --rree  flag  forces  the string to be interpreted as a regexp-
             style pattern.  In this case, matching substrings are  stored  in
             the  variable _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t___o_u_t similarly to the way eexxppeecctt stores its
             output in the variable eexxppeecctt__oouutt.  The --iinnddiicceess  flag  is  simi-
             larly supported.

             The  pattern  eeooff introduces an action that is executed upon end-
             of-file.  A separate eeooff pattern may also follow the --oouuttppuutt flag
             in  which  case it is matched if an eof is detected while writing
             output.  The default eeooff action is  ""return"",  so  that  iinntteerraacctt
             simply returns upon any EOF.

             The  pattern ttiimmeeoouutt introduces a timeout (in seconds) and action
             that is executed after no characters have been read for  a  given
             time.  The ttiimmeeoouutt pattern applies to the most recently specified
             process.  There is no  default  timeout.   The  special  variable
             ""timeout""  (used  by  the  eexxppeecctt  command) has no affect on this
             timeout.

             For example, the following statement could be used to  autologout
             users  who  have not typed anything for an hour but who still get
             frequent system messages:

                 interact -input $user_spawn_id timeout 3600 return -output \
                     $spawn_id


             If the pattern is the keyword nnuullll, and nulls  are  allowed  (via
             the  rreemmoovvee__nnuullllss command), the corresponding body is executed if
             a single ASCII 0 is matched.  It is not possible to match 0 bytes
             via glob or regexp patterns.

             Prefacing  a  pattern  with  the flag --iiwwrriittee causes the variable
             _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t___o_u_t_(_s_p_a_w_n___i_d_) to be set to the  spawn_id  which  matched
             the pattern (or eof).

             Actions  such  as  bbrreeaakk  and  ccoonnttiinnuuee  cause control structures
             (i.e., ffoorr, pprroocc) to behave in the  usual  way.   However  rreettuurrnn
             causes  interact  to  return  to  its  caller, while iinntteerr__rreettuurrnn
             causes iinntteerraacctt to cause a return in its caller.  For example, if
             ""proc  foo""  called  iinntteerraacctt  which  then  executed  the  action
             iinntteerr__rreettuurrnn, pprroocc ffoooo would return.  (This means that if  iinntteerr--
             aacctt  calls iinntteerrpprreetteerr interactively typing rreettuurrnn will cause the
             interact to continue, while iinntteerr__rreettuurrnn will cause the  interact
             to return to its caller.)

             During  iinntteerraacctt,  raw mode is used so that all characters may be
             passed to the current process.  If the current process  does  not
             catch job control signals, it will stop if sent a stop signal (by
             default ^Z).  To restart it, send a continue signal (such  as  by
             ""kill  -CONT  <pid>"").   If  you really want to send a SIGSTOP to
             such a process (by ^Z), consider spawning csh first and then run-
             ning  your  program.   On  the  other hand, if you want to send a
             SIGSTOP to EExxppeecctt itself,  first  call  interpreter  (perhaps  by
             using an escape character), and then press ^Z.

             String-body  pairs can be used as a shorthand for avoiding having
             to enter the interpreter and execute commands interactively.  The
             previous  terminal  mode  is used while the body of a string-body
             pair is being executed.

             For speed, actions execute in raw mode by  default.   The  --rreesseett
             flag  resets  the terminal to the mode it had before iinntteerraacctt was
             executed (invariably, cooked mode).  Note that characters entered
             when  the mode is being switched may be lost (an unfortunate fea-
             ture of the terminal driver on some systems).  The only reason to
             use --rreesseett is if your action depends on running in cooked mode.

             The  --eecchhoo flag sends characters that match the following pattern
             back to the process that generated  them  as  each  character  is
             read.   This  may  be  useful when the user needs to see feedback
             from partially typed patterns.

             If a pattern is being echoed but eventually fails to  match,  the
             characters  are  sent  to  the  spawned  process.  If the spawned
             process then echoes them, the user will see the characters twice.
             --eecchhoo  is  probably only appropriate in situations where the user
             is unlikely to not complete the pattern.  For example,  the  fol-
             lowing  excerpt is from rftp, the recursive-ftp script, where the
             user is prompted to enter ~g, ~p, or ~l, to get, put, or list the
             current  directory  recursively.   These are so far away from the
             normal ftp commands, that the user is unlikely to type ~ followed
             by anything else, except mistakenly, in which case, they'll prob-
             ably just ignore the result anyway.

                 interact {
                     -echo ~g {getcurdirectory 1}
                     -echo ~l {getcurdirectory 0}
                     -echo ~p {putcurdirectory}
                 }

             The --nnoobbuuffffeerr flag sends characters that match the following pat-
             tern on to the output process as characters are read.

             This  is useful when you wish to let a program echo back the pat-
             tern.  For example, the following might be used to monitor  where
             a  person  is  dialing (a Hayes-style modem).  Each time ""atd"" is
             seen the script logs the rest of the line.

                 proc lognumber {} {
                     interact -nobuffer -re ""(.*)\r"" return
                     puts $log ""[clock format [clock seconds]]: dialed $interact_out(1,string)""
                 }

                 interact -nobuffer ""atd"" lognumber


             During iinntteerraacctt, previous use of lloogg__uusseerr is ignored.  In partic-
             ular,  iinntteerraacctt  will  force its output to be logged (sent to the
             standard output) since it is presumed the user  doesn't  wish  to
             interact blindly.

             The  --oo flag causes any following key-body pairs to be applied to
             the output of the current process.  This can be useful, for exam-
             ple, when dealing with hosts that send unwanted characters during
             a telnet session.

             By default, iinntteerraacctt expects the user to  be  writing  stdin  and
             reading  stdout  of  the EExxppeecctt process itself.  The --uu flag (for
             ""user"") makes iinntteerraacctt look for the user as the process named  by
             its argument (which must be a spawned id).

             This allows two unrelated processes to be joined together without
             using an explicit loop.  To aid in debugging, Expect  diagnostics
             always  go to stderr (or stdout for certain logging and debugging
             information).  For the same reason, the iinntteerrpprreetteerr command  will
             read interactively from stdin.

             For  example,  the  following  fragment  creates a login process.
             Then it dials the user (not shown), and finally connects the  two
             together.   Of  course, any process may be substituted for login.
             A shell, for example, would allow the user to work  without  sup-
             plying an account and password.

                 spawn login
                 set login $spawn_id
                 spawn tip modem
                 # dial back out to user
                 # connect user to login
                 interact -u $login

             To  send  output  to  multiple processes, list each spawn id list
             prefaced by a --oouuttppuutt flag.  Input for a group  of  output  spawn
             ids  may  be  determined  by a spawn id list prefaced by a --iinnppuutt
             flag.  (Both --iinnppuutt and --oouuttppuutt may take lists in the  same  form
             as the --ii flag in the eexxppeecctt command, except that any_spawn_id is
             not meaningful in iinntteerraacctt.)  All following flags and strings (or
             patterns)  apply to this input until another -input flag appears.
             If no --iinnppuutt  appears,  --oouuttppuutt  implies  ""-input  $user_spawn_id
             -output"".   (Similarly,  with  patterns that do not have --iinnppuutt.)
             If one --iinnppuutt is specified, it overrides  $user_spawn_id.   If  a
             second  --iinnppuutt  is specified, it overrides $spawn_id.  Additional
             --iinnppuutt flags may be specified.

             The two implied input processes default to having  their  outputs
             specified  as  $spawn_id  and  $user_spawn_id (in reverse).  If a
             --iinnppuutt flag appears with no --oouuttppuutt flag,  characters  from  that
             process are discarded.

             The  --ii  flag  introduces  a replacement for the current spawn_id
             when no other --iinnppuutt or  --oouuttppuutt  flags  are  used.   A  -i  flag
             implies a -o flag.

             It  is possible to change the processes that are being interacted
             with by using  indirect  spawn  ids.   (Indirect  spawn  ids  are
             described  in the section on the expect command.)  Indirect spawn
             ids may be specified with the -i, -u, -input, or -output flags.

       iinntteerrpprreetteerr  [[aarrggss]]
             causes the user to be interactively prompted for EExxppeecctt  and  Tcl
             commands.  The result of each command is printed.

             Actions  such  as  bbrreeaakk  and  ccoonnttiinnuuee  cause control structures
             (i.e., ffoorr, pprroocc) to behave in the  usual  way.   However  rreettuurrnn
             causes  interpreter  to  return to its caller, while iinntteerr__rreettuurrnn
             causes iinntteerrpprreetteerr to cause a return in its caller.  For example,
             if  ""proc  foo"" called iinntteerrpprreetteerr which then executed the action
             iinntteerr__rreettuurrnn, pprroocc ffoooo would return.  Any  other  command  causes
             iinntteerrpprreetteerr to continue prompting for new commands.

             By  default, the prompt contains two integers.  The first integer
             describes the depth of the evaluation stack (i.e., how many times
             Tcl_Eval has been called).  The second integer is the Tcl history
             identifier.  The prompt can be set by defining a procedure called
             ""prompt1""  whose  return  value  becomes  the  next prompt.  If a
             statement has open quotes, parens, braces, or  brackets,  a  sec-
             ondary  prompt  (by  default  ""+> "") is issued upon newline.  The
             secondary prompt may  be  set  by  defining  a  procedure  called
             ""prompt2"".

             During  iinntteerrpprreetteerr,  cooked mode is used, even if the its caller
             was using raw mode.

             If stdin is closed, iinntteerrpprreetteerr will return unless the --eeooff  flag
             is used, in which case the subsequent argument is invoked.

       lloogg__ffiillee _[_a_r_g_s_] _[_[_-_a_] _f_i_l_e_]
             If  a  filename is provided, lloogg__ffiillee will record a transcript of
             the session (beginning at that point) in the file.  lloogg__ffiillee will
             stop recording if no argument is given.  Any previous log file is
             closed.

             Instead of a filename, a Tcl file identifier may be  provided  by
             using  the  --ooppeenn  or  --lleeaavveeooppeenn  flags.  This is similar to the
             ssppaawwnn command.  (See ssppaawwnn for more info.)

             The --aa flag forces output to be logged that was suppressed by the
             lloogg__uusseerr command.

             By default, the lloogg__ffiillee command _a_p_p_e_n_d_s to old files rather than
             truncating them, for the convenience of being able to  turn  log-
             ging  off  and  on  multiple  times  in one session.  To truncate
             files, use the --nnooaappppeenndd flag.

             The --iinnffoo flag causes log_file to return  a  description  of  the
             most recent non-info arguments given.

       lloogg__uusseerr _-_i_n_f_o_|_0_|_1
             By  default,  the send/expect dialogue is logged to stdout (and a
             logfile if open).  The logging to stdout is disabled by the  com-
             mand  ""log_user 0"" and reenabled by ""log_user 1"".  Logging to the
             logfile is unchanged.

             The --iinnffoo flag causes log_user to return  a  description  of  the
             most recent non-info arguments given.

             defines  the  size  of  the  buffer (in bytes) used internally by
             eexxppeecctt.  With no _s_i_z_e argument, the current size is returned.

             With the --dd flag, the default size is set.  (The initial  default
             is  2000.)  With the --ii flag, the size is set for the named spawn
             id, otherwise it is set for the current process.

             executes _p_r_o_g_r_a_m _a_r_g_s in place of  the  current  EExxppeecctt  program,
             which  terminates.   A  bare  hyphen  argument forces a hyphen in
             front of the command name as  if  it  was  a  login  shell.   All
             spawn_ids  are closed except for those named as arguments.  These
             are mapped onto the named file identifiers.

             Spawn_ids are mapped to file identifiers for the new  program  to
             inherit.   For  example, the following line runs chess and allows
             it to be controlled by the current process - say, a chess master.

                 overlay -0 $spawn_id -1 $spawn_id -2 $spawn_id chess

             This is more efficient than ""interact -u"", however, it sacrifices
             the ability to do programmed interaction since the EExxppeecctt process
             is no longer in control.

             Note that no controlling terminal is provided.  Thus, if you dis-
             connect or remap standard input, programs  that  do  job  control
             (shells, login, etc) will not function properly.

       ppaarriittyy _[_-_d_] _[_-_i _s_p_a_w_n___i_d_] _[_v_a_l_u_e_]
             defines  whether  parity  should be retained or stripped from the
             output of  spawned  processes.   If  _v_a_l_u_e  is  zero,  parity  is
             stripped,  otherwise it is not stripped.  With no _v_a_l_u_e argument,
             the current value is returned.

             With the --dd flag, the default parity value is set.  (The  initial
             default  is  1, i.e., parity is not stripped.)  With the --ii flag,
             the parity value is set for the named spawn id, otherwise  it  is
             set for the current process.

       rreemmoovvee__nnuullllss _[_-_d_] _[_-_i _s_p_a_w_n___i_d_] _[_v_a_l_u_e_]
             defines  whether nulls are retained or removed from the output of
             spawned processes before pattern matching or storing in the vari-
             able  _e_x_p_e_c_t___o_u_t  or  _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t___o_u_t.   If  _v_a_l_u_e  is  1, nulls are
             removed.  If _v_a_l_u_e is 0, nulls are not removed.   With  no  _v_a_l_u_e
             argument, the current value is returned.

             With the --dd flag, the default value is set.  (The initial default
             is 1, i.e., nulls are removed.)  With the --ii flag, the  value  is
             set  for  the named spawn id, otherwise it is set for the current
             process.

             Whether or not nulls are removed, EExxppeecctt will record  null  bytes
             to the log and stdout.

       sseenndd _[_-_f_l_a_g_s_] _s_t_r_i_n_g
             Sends _s_t_r_i_n_g to the current process.  For example, the command

                 send ""hello world\r""

             sends the characters, h e l l o <blank> w o r l d <return> to the
             current process.  (Tcl includes  a  printf-like  command  (called
             ffoorrmmaatt) which can build arbitrarily complex strings.)

             Characters  are  sent  immediately  although  programs with line-
             buffered input will not read the characters until a return  char-
             acter is sent.  A return character is denoted ""\r"".

             The  ----  flag  forces  the  next  argument to be interpreted as a
             string rather than a flag.  Any string can be  preceded  by  ""--""
             whether  or  not  it actually looks like a flag.  This provides a
             reliable mechanism to  specify  variable  strings  without  being
             tripped  up  by  those  that  accidentally look like flags.  (All
             strings starting with ""-"" are reserved for future options.)

             The --ii flag declares  that  the  string  be  sent  to  the  named
             spawn_id.   If the spawn_id is _u_s_e_r___s_p_a_w_n___i_d, and the terminal is
             in raw mode, newlines in the string are translated to return-new-
             line  sequences  so  that  they  appear as if the terminal was in
             cooked mode.  The --rraaww flag disables this translation.

             The --nnuullll flag sends null characters (0 bytes).  By default,  one
             null  is  sent.   An integer may follow the --nnuullll to indicate how
             many nulls to send.

             The --bbrreeaakk flag generates a break  condition.   This  only  makes
             sense  if  the  spawn id refers to a tty device opened via ""spawn
             -open"".  If you have spawned a process such as  tip,  you  should
             use tip's convention for generating a break.

             The  --ss  flag  forces  output to be sent ""slowly"", thus avoid the
             common situation where a computer outtypes an input  buffer  that
             was designed for a human who would never outtype the same buffer.
             This  output  is  controlled  by  the  value  of   the   variable
             ""send_slow"" which takes a two element list.  The first element is
             an integer that describes the number of bytes to send atomically.
             The  second element is a real number that describes the number of
             seconds by which the atomic sends must be separated.   For  exam-
             ple,  ""set  send_slow  {10  .001}""  would force ""send -s"" to send
             strings with 1 millisecond in between each 10 characters sent.

             The --hh flag forces output to be  sent  (somewhat)  like  a  human
             actually  typing.   Human-like  delays appear between the charac-
             ters.  (The algorithm is based upon a Weibull distribution,  with
             modifications  to suit this particular application.)  This output
             is controlled by the value of  the  variable  ""send_human""  which
             takes  a  five  element list.  The first two elements are average
             interarrival time of characters in seconds.  The first is used by
             default.   The  second  is  used at word endings, to simulate the
             subtle pauses that occasionally occur at such  transitions.   The
             third  parameter  is  a  measure of variability where .1 is quite
             variable, 1 is reasonably variable, and 10 is  quite  invariable.
             The  extremes  are  0  to infinity.  The last two parameters are,
             respectively, a minimum and maximum interarrival time.  The mini-
             mum  and  maximum  are  used last and ""clip"" the final time.  The
             ultimate average can be quite different from the given average if
             the minimum and maximum clip enough values.

             As  an example, the following command emulates a fast and consis-
             tent typist:

                 set send_human {.1 .3 1 .05 2}
                 send -h ""I'm hungry.  Let's do lunch.""

             while the following might be more suitable after a hangover:

                 set send_human {.4 .4 .2 .5 100}
                 send -h ""Goodd party lash night!""

             Note that errors are not simulated, although you can set up error
             correction  situations yourself by embedding mistakes and correc-
             tions in a send argument.

             The flags for sending null characters, for  sending  breaks,  for
             forcing  slow  output  and  for  human-style  output are mutually
             exclusive. Only the one specified last will be used. Furthermore,
             no  _s_t_r_i_n_g  argument  can be specified with the flags for sending
             null characters or breaks.

             It is a good idea to precede the first sseenndd to a  process  by  an
             eexxppeecctt.   eexxppeecctt  will  wait for the process to start, while sseenndd
             cannot.  In particular, if the first sseenndd  completes  before  the
             process  starts  running,  you  run  the risk of having your data
             ignored.  In situations where interactive programs offer no  ini-
             tial prompt, you can precede sseenndd by a delay as in:

                 # To avoid giving hackers hints on how to break in,
                 # this system does not prompt for an external password.
                 # Wait for 5 seconds for exec to complete
                 spawn telnet very.secure.gov
                 sleep 5
                 send password\r

             eexxpp__sseenndd  is an alias for sseenndd_.  If you are using Expectk or some
             other variant of Expect in the Tk environment, sseenndd is defined by
             Tk  for  an entirely different purpose.  eexxpp__sseenndd is provided for
             compatibility between environments.  Similar aliases are provided
             for other Expect's other send commands.

       sseenndd__eerrrroorr _[_-_f_l_a_g_s_] _s_t_r_i_n_g
             is  like  sseenndd,  except  that the output is sent to stderr rather
             than the current process.

       sseenndd__lloogg _[_-_-_] _s_t_r_i_n_g
             is like sseenndd, except that the string is only sent to the log file
             (see  lloogg__ffiillee.)   The  arguments  are  ignored if no log file is
             open.

       sseenndd__ttttyy _[_-_f_l_a_g_s_] _s_t_r_i_n_g
             is like sseenndd, except that the output is sent to  /dev/tty  rather
             than the current process.

       sseenndd__uusseerr _[_-_f_l_a_g_s_] _s_t_r_i_n_g
             is  like  sseenndd,  except  that the output is sent to stdout rather
             than the current process.

       sslleeeepp _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
             causes the script to sleep for the given number of seconds.  Sec-
             onds  may  be a decimal number.  Interrupts (and Tk events if you
             are using Expectk) are processed while Expect sleeps.

       ssppaawwnn _[_a_r_g_s_] _p_r_o_g_r_a_m _[_a_r_g_s_]
             creates a new process running _p_r_o_g_r_a_m _a_r_g_s.   Its  stdin,  stdout
             and  stderr are connected to Expect, so that they may be read and
             written by other EExxppeecctt commands.  The connection  is  broken  by
             cclloossee  or  if  the  process itself closes any of the file identi-
             fiers.

             When a process is started by ssppaawwnn, the variable _s_p_a_w_n___i_d is  set
             to a descriptor referring to that process.  The process described
             by _s_p_a_w_n___i_d is considered the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _p_r_o_c_e_s_s.  _s_p_a_w_n___i_d  may  be
             read or written, in effect providing job control.

             _u_s_e_r___s_p_a_w_n___i_d  is a global variable containing a descriptor which
             refers to the user.  For example, when _s_p_a_w_n___i_d is  set  to  this
             value, eexxppeecctt behaves like eexxppeecctt__uusseerr.

             _e_r_r_o_r___s_p_a_w_n___i_d is a global variable containing a descriptor which
             refers to the standard error.  For example, when _s_p_a_w_n___i_d is  set
             to this value, sseenndd behaves like sseenndd__eerrrroorr.

             _t_t_y___s_p_a_w_n___i_d  is  a global variable containing a descriptor which
             refers to /dev/tty.  If /dev/tty does not exist  (such  as  in  a
             cron,  at,  or  batch  script), then _t_t_y___s_p_a_w_n___i_d is not defined.
             This may be tested as:

                 if {[info vars tty_spawn_id]} {
                     # /dev/tty exists
                 } else {
                     # /dev/tty doesn't exist
                     # probably in cron, batch, or at script
                 }


             ssppaawwnn returns the UNIX process id.  If no process is  spawned,  0
             is  returned.   The  variable _s_p_a_w_n___o_u_t_(_s_l_a_v_e_,_n_a_m_e_) is set to the
             name of the pty slave device.

             By default, ssppaawwnn echoes the command  name  and  arguments.   The
             --nnooeecchhoo flag stops ssppaawwnn from doing this.

             The  --ccoonnssoollee  flag causes console output to be redirected to the
             spawned process.  This is not supported on all systems.

             Internally, ssppaawwnn uses a pty, initialized the  same  way  as  the
             user's tty.  This is further initialized so that all settings are
             ""sane"" (according to stty(1)).   If  the  variable  _s_t_t_y___i_n_i_t  is
             defined, it is interpreted in the style of stty arguments as fur-
             ther configuration.  For example, ""set stty_init raw"" will  cause
             further  spawned  processes's  terminals  to  start  in raw mode.
             --nnoottttyyccooppyy skips the initialization  based  on  the  user's  tty.
             --nnoottttyyiinniitt skips the ""sane"" initialization.

             Normally,  ssppaawwnn  takes  little  time  to execute.  If you notice
             spawn taking a significant amount of time, it is probably encoun-
             tering  ptys  that are wedged.  A number of tests are run on ptys
             to avoid entanglements with errant  processes.   (These  take  10
             seconds  per wedged pty.)  Running Expect with the --dd option will
             show if EExxppeecctt is encountering many ptys in odd states.   If  you
             cannot  kill the processes to which these ptys are attached, your
             only recourse may be to reboot.

             If _p_r_o_g_r_a_m cannot be spawned successfully because  exec(2)  fails
             (e.g.  when  _p_r_o_g_r_a_m  doesn't  exist),  an  error message will be
             returned by the next iinntteerraacctt or eexxppeecctt command as if _p_r_o_g_r_a_m had
             run and produced the error message as output.  This behavior is a
             natural consequence of the implementation of ssppaawwnn.   Internally,
             spawn forks, after which the spawned process has no way to commu-
             nicate with the original EExxppeecctt process except  by  communication
             via the spawn_id.

             The  --ooppeenn  flag  causes the next argument to be interpreted as a
             Tcl file identifier (i.e., returned by ooppeenn.)  The spawn  id  can
             then  be used as if it were a spawned process.  (The file identi-
             fier should no longer be used.)  This lets you treat raw devices,
             files, and pipelines as spawned processes without using a pty.  0
             is returned to indicate there is no associated process.  When the
             connection  to  the spawned process is closed, so is the Tcl file
             identifier.  The --lleeaavveeooppeenn flag is similar to --ooppeenn except  that
             --lleeaavveeooppeenn  causes the file identifier to be left open even after
             the spawn id is closed.

             The --ppttyy flag causes a pty to be opened but no  process  spawned.
             0  is  returned  to  indicate  there  is  no  associated process.
             Spawn_id is set as usual.

             The variable _s_p_a_w_n___o_u_t_(_s_l_a_v_e_,_f_d_) is set to a file identifier cor-
             responding  to  the  pty  slave.   It  can be closed using ""close
             -slave"".

             The --iiggnnoorree flag names a signal to  be  ignored  in  the  spawned
             process.   Otherwise,  signals get the default behavior.  Signals
             are named as  in  the  ttrraapp  command,  except  that  each  signal
             requires a separate flag.

       ssttrraaccee _l_e_v_e_l
             causes  following statements to be printed before being executed.
             (Tcl's trace command traces variables.)  _l_e_v_e_l indicates how  far
             down in the call stack to trace.  For example, the following com-
             mand runs EExxppeecctt while tracing the first 4 levels of  calls,  but
             none below that.

                 expect -c ""strace 4"" script.exp


             The  --iinnffoo flag causes strace to return a description of the most
             recent non-info arguments given.

       ssttttyy _a_r_g_s
             changes terminal modes similarly to the external stty command.

             By default, the controlling terminal is accessed.   Other  termi-
             nals can be accessed by appending ""< /dev/tty..."" to the command.
             (Note that the arguments should not  be  grouped  into  a  single
             argument.)

             Requests  for  status return it as the result of the command.  If
             no status is requested and the controlling terminal is  accessed,
             the  previous  status of the raw and echo attributes are returned
             in a form which can later be used by the command.

             For example, the arguments rraaww or --ccooookkeedd put the  terminal  into
             raw  mode.   The  arguments  --rraaww or ccooookkeedd put the terminal into
             cooked mode.  The arguments eecchhoo and --eecchhoo put the terminal  into
             echo and noecho mode respectively.

             The  following  example  illustrates  how  to temporarily disable
             echoing.  This could be used in  otherwise-automatic  scripts  to
             avoid  embedding passwords in them.  (See more discussion on this
             under EXPECT HINTS below.)

                 stty -echo
                 send_user ""Password: ""
                 expect_user -re ""(.*)\n""
                 set password $expect_out(1,string)
                 stty echo


       ssyysstteemm _a_r_g_s
             gives _a_r_g_s to sh(1) as input, just as if it had been typed  as  a
             command  from  a  terminal.   EExxppeecctt waits until the shell termi-
             nates.  The return status from sh is handled the  same  way  that
             eexxeecc handles its return status.

             In  contrast  to  eexxeecc  which  redirects  stdin and stdout to the
             script, ssyysstteemm performs no redirection (other than that indicated
             by  the  string  itself).   Thus,  it is possible to use programs
             which must talk directly to /dev/tty.  For the same  reason,  the
             results of ssyysstteemm are not recorded in the log.

       ttiimmeessttaammpp _[_a_r_g_s_]
             returns  a  timestamp.   With no arguments, the number of seconds
             since the epoch is returned.

             The --ffoorrmmaatt flag introduces a string which is returned  but  with
             substitutions  made  according  to  the POSIX rules for strftime.
             For example %a is replaced by an abbreviated weekday name  (i.e.,
             Sat).  Others are:
                 %a      abbreviated weekday name
                 %A      full weekday name
                 %b      abbreviated month name
                 %B      full month name
                 %c      date-time as in: Wed Oct  6 11:45:56 1993
                 %d      day of the month (01-31)
                 %H      hour (00-23)
                 %I      hour (01-12)
                 %j      day (001-366)
                 %m      month (01-12)
                 %M      minute (00-59)
                 %p      am or pm
                 %S      second (00-61)
                 %u      day (1-7, Monday is first day of week)
                 %U      week (00-53, first Sunday is first day of week one)
                 %V      week (01-53, ISO 8601 style)
                 %w      day (0-6)
                 %W      week (00-53, first Monday is first day of week one)
                 %x      date-time as in: Wed Oct  6 1993
                 %X      time as in: 23:59:59
                 %y      year (00-99)
                 %Y      year as in: 1993
                 %Z      timezone (or nothing if not determinable)
                 %%      a bare percent sign

             Other  %  specifications are undefined.  Other characters will be
             passed through untouched.  Only the C locale is supported.

             The --sseeccoonnddss flag introduces a number of seconds since the  epoch
             to be used as a source from which to format.  Otherwise, the cur-
             rent time is used.

             The --ggmmtt flag forces timestamp output to use  the  GMT  timezone.
             With no flag, the local timezone is used.

       ttrraapp _[_[_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_] _s_i_g_n_a_l_s_]
             causes  the  given  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d to be executed upon future receipt of
             any of the given signals.  The command is executed in the  global
             scope.   If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is absent, the signal action is returned.  If
             _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is the string SIG_IGN, the signals are ignored.  If  _c_o_m_-
             _m_a_n_d  is the string SIG_DFL, the signals are result to the system
             default.  _s_i_g_n_a_l_s is either a single signal or a list of signals.
             Signals  may be specified numerically or symbolically as per sig-
             nal(3).  The ""SIG"" prefix may be omitted.

             With no arguments (or the argument  -number),  ttrraapp  returns  the
             signal number of the trap command currently being executed.

             The  --ccooddee  flag  uses the return code of the command in place of
             whatever code Tcl was about to return when the command originally
             started running.

             The  --iinntteerrpp  flag  causes  the command to be evaluated using the
             interpreter active at the time the command started running rather
             than when the trap was declared.

             The  --nnaammee flag causes the ttrraapp command to return the signal name
             of the trap command currently being executed.

             The --mmaaxx flag causes the ttrraapp command to return the largest  sig-
             nal number that can be set.

             For  example,  the command ""trap {send_user ""Ouch!""} SIGINT"" will
             print ""Ouch!""  each time the user presses ^C.

             By default, SIGINT (which can usually be  generated  by  pressing
             ^C) and SIGTERM cause Expect to exit.  This is due to the follow-
             ing trap, created by default when Expect starts.

                 trap exit {SIGINT SIGTERM}

             If you use the -D flag to start the debugger, SIGINT is redefined
             to  start the interactive debugger.  This is due to the following
             trap:

                 trap {exp_debug 1} SIGINT

             The debugger trap can be changed by setting the environment vari-
             able EXPECT_DEBUG_INIT to a new trap command.

             You  can,  of  course, override both of these just by adding trap
             commands to your script.  In particular, if  you  have  your  own
             ""trap  exit  SIGINT"", this will override the debugger trap.  This
             is useful if you want to prevent users from getting to the debug-
             ger at all.

             If  you  want to define your own trap on SIGINT but still trap to
             the debugger when it is running, use:

                 if {![exp_debug]} {trap mystuff SIGINT}

             Alternatively, you can trap to the debugger using some other sig-
             nal.

             ttrraapp  will not let you override the action for SIGALRM as this is
             used internally to EExxppeecctt.  The disconnect command  sets  SIGALRM
             to  SIG_IGN  (ignore).  You can reenable this as long as you dis-
             able it during subsequent spawn commands.

             See signal(3) for more info.

       wwaaiitt _[_a_r_g_s_]
             delays until a spawned process (or the current process if none is
             named) terminates.

             wwaaiitt normally returns a list of four integers.  The first integer
             is the pid of the process that was waited upon.  The second inte-
             ger is the corresponding spawn id.  The third integer is -1 if an
             operating system error occurred, or 0 otherwise.   If  the  third
             integer  was  0, the fourth integer is the status returned by the
             spawned process.  If the third integer was -1, the fourth integer
             is  the  value  of errno set by the operating system.  The global
             variable errorCode is also set.

             Additional elements may appear at the end  of  the  return  value
             from  wwaaiitt.   An  optional  fifth  element  identifies a class of
             information.  Currently, the only possible value for this element
             is  CHILDKILLED in which case the next two values are the C-style
             signal name and a short textual description.

             The --ii flag declares the process to  wait  corresponding  to  the
             named  spawn_id  (NOT the process id).  Inside a SIGCHLD handler,
             it is possible to wait for any spawned process by using the spawn
             id -1.

             The  --nnoowwaaiitt  flag causes the wait to return immediately with the
             indication of a successful wait.  When the process exits (later),
             it  will automatically disappear without the need for an explicit
             wait.

             The wwaaiitt command may also be used wait for a forked process using
             the  arguments  ""-i  -1"".  Unlike its use with spawned processes,
             this command can be executed at any time.  There  is  no  control
             over  which  process is reaped.  However, the return value can be
             checked for the process id.


LLIIBBRRAARRIIEESS
       Expect automatically knows about  two  built-in  libraries  for  Expect
       scripts.   These  are defined by the directories named in the variables
       exp_library and exp_exec_library.  Both are meant  to  contain  utility
       files that can be used by other scripts.

       exp_library  contains architecture-independent files.  exp_exec_library
       contains architecture-dependent files.  Depending on your system,  both
       directories   may   be  totally  empty.   The  existence  of  the  file
       $exp_exec_library/cat-buffers describes whether your  /bin/cat  buffers
       by default.

       A  vgrind  definition  is available for pretty-printing EExxppeecctt scripts.
       Assuming the vgrind definition supplied with the EExxppeecctt distribution is
       correctly installed, you can use it as:

           vgrind -lexpect file


EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       It  many  not  be  apparent how to put everything together that the man
       page describes.  I encourage you to read and try out  the  examples  in
       the  example  directory  of  the EExxppeecctt distribution.  Some of them are
       real programs.  Others are simply illustrative of  certain  techniques,
       and  of  course, a couple are just quick hacks.  The INSTALL file has a
       quick overview of these programs.

       The EExxppeecctt papers (see SEE ALSO) are also useful.   While  some  papers
       use  syntax corresponding to earlier versions of Expect, the accompany-
       ing rationales are still valid and go into a lot more detail than  this
       man page.

CCAAVVEEAATTSS
       Extensions  may collide with Expect's command names.  For example, sseenndd
       is defined by Tk for an entirely different purpose.  For  this  reason,
       most of the EExxppeecctt commands are also available as ""exp_XXXX"".  Commands
       and variables beginning with ""exp"", ""inter"", ""spawn"", and ""timeout""  do
       not have aliases.  Use the extended command names if you need this com-
       patibility between environments.

       EExxppeecctt takes a rather liberal view of scoping.   In  particular,  vari-
       ables  read  by  commands specific to the EExxppeecctt program will be sought
       first from the local scope, and if not found, in the global scope.  For
       example, this obviates the need to place ""global timeout"" in every pro-
       cedure you write that uses eexxppeecctt.  On the other hand, variables  writ-
       ten  are  always in the local scope (unless a ""global"" command has been
       issued).  The most common problem this causes is when spawn is executed
       in  a  procedure.  Outside the procedure, _s_p_a_w_n___i_d no longer exists, so
       the spawned process is no longer accessible simply because of  scoping.
       Add a ""global spawn_id"" to such a procedure.

       If  you  cannot  enable the multispawning capability (i.e., your system
       supports neither select (BSD *.*), poll (SVR>2), nor something  equiva-
       lent),  EExxppeecctt will only be able to control a single process at a time.
       In this case, do not attempt to set _s_p_a_w_n___i_d, nor  should  you  execute
       processes  via  exec  while a spawned process is running.  Furthermore,
       you will not be able to eexxppeecctt from multiple processes  (including  the
       user as one) at the same time.

       Terminal  parameters can have a big effect on scripts.  For example, if
       a script is written to look for echoing, it will misbehave  if  echoing
       is turned off.  For this reason, Expect forces sane terminal parameters
       by default.  Unfortunately, this can make things unpleasant  for  other
       programs.   As  an example, the emacs shell wants to change the ""usual""
       mappings: newlines get mapped to newlines  instead  of  carriage-return
       newlines,  and  echoing  is  disabled.  This allows one to use emacs to
       edit the input line.  Unfortunately, Expect cannot possibly guess this.

       You  can request that Expect not override its default setting of termi-
       nal parameters, but you must then be very careful when writing  scripts
       for  such  environments.   In  the  case of emacs, avoid depending upon
       things like echoing and end-of-line mappings.

       The commands that accepted arguments braced into  a  single  list  (the
       eexxppeecctt  variants and iinntteerraacctt) use a heuristic to decide if the list is
       actually one argument or many.  The heuristic can fail only in the case
       when  the list actually does represent a single argument which has mul-
       tiple embedded \n's with non-whitespace characters between them.   This
       seems  sufficiently  improbable, however the argument ""-nobrace"" can be
       used to force a single argument to be handled  as  a  single  argument.
       This  could  conceivably  be  used  with machine-generated Expect code.
       Similarly, -brace forces a single argument to  be  handle  as  multiple
       patterns/actions.


BBUUGGSS
       It  was  really  tempting  to name the program ""sex"" (for either ""Smart
       EXec"" or ""Send-EXpect""), but good sense (or  perhaps  just  Puritanism)
       prevailed.

       On  some systems, when a shell is spawned, it complains about not being
       able to access the tty but runs anyway.  This means your system  has  a
       mechanism  for  gaining  the  controlling  tty that EExxppeecctt doesn't know
       about.  Please find out what it is, and send this information  back  to
       me.

       Ultrix  4.1  (at least the latest versions around here) considers time-
       outs of above 1000000 to be equivalent to 0.

       Digital UNIX 4.0A (and probably other  versions)  refuses  to  allocate
       ptys  if you define a SIGCHLD handler.  See grantpt page for more info.

       IRIX 6.0 does not handle pty permissions correctly so  that  if  Expect
       attempts  to  allocate a pty previously used by someone else, it fails.
       Upgrade to IRIX 6.1.

       Telnet (verified only under SunOS 4.1.2) hangs  if  TERM  is  not  set.
       This  is  a  problem  under  cron,  at and in cgi scripts, which do not
       define TERM.  Thus, you must set it explicitly - to what type  is  usu-
       ally  irrelevant.   It  just has to be set to something!  The following
       probably suffices for most cases.

           set env(TERM) vt100


       Tip (verified only under BSDI BSD/OS 3.1 i386) hangs if SHELL and  HOME
       are  not  set.   This  is  a problem under cron, at and in cgi scripts,
       which do not define these environment variables.  Thus,  you  must  set
       them  explicitly  - to what type is usually irrelevant.  It just has to
       be set to something!  The following probably suffices for most cases.

           set env(SHELL) /bin/sh
           set env(HOME) /usr/local/bin



       Some implementations of ptys are designed so  that  the  kernel  throws
       away  any unread output after 10 to 15 seconds (actual number is imple-
       mentation-dependent) after the process has closed the file  descriptor.
       Thus EExxppeecctt programs such as

           spawn date
           sleep 20
           expect

       will  fail.   To  avoid this, invoke non-interactive programs with eexxeecc
       rather than ssppaawwnn.  While such situations are conceivable, in  practice
       I  have  never  encountered  a situation in which the final output of a
       truly interactive program would be lost due to this behavior.

       On the other hand, Cray UNICOS ptys throw away any unread output  imme-
       diately  after  the  process  has  closed  the file descriptor.  I have
       reported this to Cray and they are working on a fix.

       Sometimes a delay is required between a prompt and a response, such  as
       when  a  tty interface is changing UART settings or matching baud rates
       by looking for start/stop bits.  Usually, all this  is  require  is  to
       sleep  for  a second or two.  A more robust technique is to retry until
       the hardware is ready to receive input.   The  following  example  uses
       both strategies:

           send ""speed 9600\r"";
           sleep 1
           expect {
               timeout {send ""\r""; exp_continue}
               $prompt
           }


       trap  -code  will  not  work  with any command that sits in Tcl's event
       loop, such as sleep.  The problem is that in the event loop,  Tcl  dis-
       cards  the  return codes from async event handlers.  A workaround is to
       set a flag in the trap code.  Then check the flag immediately after the
       command (i.e., sleep).

       The  expect_background  command  ignores  -timeout arguments and has no
       concept of timeouts in general.


EEXXPPEECCTT HHIINNTTSS
       There are a couple of things about EExxppeecctt that  may  be  non-intuitive.
       This  section attempts to address some of these things with a couple of
       suggestions.

       A common expect problem is how to recognize shell prompts.  Since these
       are  customized differently by differently people and different shells,
       portably automating rlogin can be difficult without knowing the prompt.
       A  reasonable  convention  is  to have users store a regular expression
       describing their prompt (in particular, the end of it) in the  environ-
       ment  variable EXPECT_PROMPT.  Code like the following can be used.  If
       EXPECT_PROMPT doesn't exist, the code still has a good chance of  func-
       tioning correctly.

           set prompt ""(%|#|\\$) $""          ;# default prompt
           catch {set prompt $env(EXPECT_PROMPT)}

           expect -re $prompt

       I  encourage you to write eexxppeecctt patterns that include the end of what-
       ever you expect to see.  This avoids the  possibility  of  answering  a
       question  before  seeing  the entire thing.  In addition, while you may
       well be able to answer questions before seeing them  entirely,  if  you
       answer  early,  your answer may appear echoed back in the middle of the
       question.  In other words, the resulting dialogue will be  correct  but
       look scrambled.

       Most  prompts  include  a space character at the end.  For example, the
       prompt from ftp is 'f', 't', 'p',  '>'  and  <blank>.   To  match  this
       prompt,  you must account for each of these characters.  It is a common
       mistake not to include the blank.  Put the blank in explicitly.

       If you use a pattern of the form X*, the * will match  all  the  output
       received  from  the  end  of X to the last thing received.  This sounds
       intuitive but can be somewhat confusing because the phrase ""last  thing
       received""  can  vary  depending  upon the speed of the computer and the
       processing of I/O both by the kernel and the device driver.

       In particular, humans tend to  see  program  output  arriving  in  huge
       chunks  (atomically)  when  in reality most programs produce output one
       line at a time.  Assuming this is the case, the * in the pattern of the
       previous  paragraph  may  only  match  the end of the current line even
       though there seems to be more, because at the time of  the  match  that
       was all the output that had been received.

       eexxppeecctt  has no way of knowing that further output is coming unless your
       pattern specifically accounts for it.

       Even depending on line-oriented buffering is unwise.  Not only do  pro-
       grams  rarely  make  promises  about the type of buffering they do, but
       system indigestion can break output lines up so  that  lines  break  at
       seemingly random places.  Thus, if you can express the last few charac-
       ters of a prompt when writing patterns, it is wise to do so.

       If you are waiting for a pattern in the last output of  a  program  and
       the  program  emits  something  else  instead,  you will not be able to
       detect that with the ttiimmeeoouutt keyword.  The reason is that  eexxppeecctt  will
       not timeout - instead it will get an eeooff indication.  Use that instead.
       Even better, use both.  That way if that line is ever moved around, you
       won't have to edit the line itself.

       Newlines  are  usually converted to carriage return, linefeed sequences
       when output by the terminal driver.  Thus, if you want a  pattern  that
       explicitly  matches  the  two lines, from, say, printf(""foo\nbar""), you
       should use the pattern ""foo\r\nbar"".

       A  similar  translation  occurs  when  reading  from  the   user,   via
       eexxppeecctt__uusseerr.   In  this  case, when you press return, it will be trans-
       lated to a newline.  If EExxppeecctt then passes that to a program which sets
       its terminal to raw mode (like telnet), there is going to be a problem,
       as the program expects a true return.  (Some programs are actually for-
       giving  in  that they will automatically translate newlines to returns,
       but most don't.)  Unfortunately, there is no way to  find  out  that  a
       program put its terminal into raw mode.

       Rather  than  manually replacing newlines with returns, the solution is
       to use the command ""stty raw"", which will stop the translation.   Note,
       however,  that  this means that you will no longer get the cooked line-
       editing features.

       iinntteerraacctt implicitly sets your terminal to raw mode so this problem will
       not arise then.

       It is often useful to store passwords (or other private information) in
       EExxppeecctt scripts.  This is not recommended since anything that is  stored
       on a computer is susceptible to being accessed by anyone.  Thus, inter-
       actively prompting for passwords from a script is a smarter  idea  than
       embedding them literally.  Nonetheless, sometimes such embedding is the
       only possibility.

       Unfortunately, the UNIX file system  has  no  direct  way  of  creating
       scripts  which  are  executable  but unreadable.  Systems which support
       setgid shell scripts may indirectly simulate this as follows:

       Create the EExxppeecctt script (that contains  the  secret  data)  as  usual.
       Make  its permissions be 750 (-rwxr-x---) and owned by a trusted group,
       i.e., a group which is allowed to read it.  If necessary, create a  new
       group for this purpose.  Next, create a /bin/sh script with permissions
       2751 (-rwxr-s--x) owned by the same group as before.

       The result is a script which may be  executed  (and  read)  by  anyone.
       When invoked, it runs the EExxppeecctt script.

       Thanks to John Ousterhout for Tcl, and Scott Paisley  for  inspiration.
       Thanks to Rob Savoye for Expect's autoconfiguration code.

       The  HISTORY  file documents much of the evolution of eexxppeecctt.  It makes
       interesting reading and might give you further insight  to  this  soft-
       ware.   Thanks  to the people mentioned in it who sent me bug fixes and
       gave other assistance.

       Design and implementation of EExxppeecctt was paid for in part  by  the  U.S.
       government  and  is therefore in the public domain.  However the author
       and NIST would like credit if this program and  documentation  or  por-
       tions of them are used.

       indented listing of files, which is  colorized  ala  _d_i_r_c_o_l_o_r_s  if  the
       LLSS__CCOOLLOORRSS  environment  variable  is set and output is to tty.  With no
       arguments, _t_r_e_e lists the files in the current directory.  When  direc-
       tory  arguments  are given, _t_r_e_e lists all the files and/or directories
       found in the given directories each in turn.  Upon completion of  list-
       ing all files/directories found, _t_r_e_e returns the total number of files
       and/or directories listed.

       By default, when a symbolic link is encountered, the path that the sym-
       bolic  link refers to is printed after the name of the link in the for-
       mat:

           name -> real-path

       If the `--ll' option is given and the symbolic link refers to  an  actual
       directory, then _t_r_e_e will follow the path of the symbolic link as if it
       were a real directory.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _T_r_e_e understands the following command line switches:


LLIISSTTIINNGG OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aa     All files are printed.  By default tree does  not  print  hidden
              files  (those  beginning with a dot `.').  In no event does tree
              print the file system constructs  `.'  (current  directory)  and
              `..' (previous directory).


       --dd     List directories only.


       --ll     Follows  symbolic links if they point to directories, as if they
              were directories. Symbolic links that will result  in  recursion
              are avoided when detected.


       --ff     Prints the full path prefix for each file.


       --xx     Stay on the current file-system only.  Ala ffiinndd _-_x_d_e_v..


       --LL _l_e_v_e_l
              Max display depth of the directory tree.


       --RR     Recursively  cross  down the tree each _l_e_v_e_l directories (see --LL
              option), and at each of  them  execute  ttrreeee  again  adding  `-o
              00Tree.html' as a new option.


       --PP _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              List  only  those files that match the wild-card _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  Note:
              you must use the _-_a option to also consider those  files  begin-
              ning with a dot `.'  for matching.  Valid wildcard operators are
              `*' (any zero or more characters), `?' (any  single  character),
              `[...]'  (any single character listed between brackets (optional
              - (dash) for character  range  may  be  used:  ex:  [A-Z]),  and
              `[^...]'  (any  single character not listed in brackets) and `|'
              separates alternate patterns.


       --II _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Do not list those files that match the wild-card _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.


       ----iiggnnoorree--ccaassee
              If a match pattern is specified by the --PP  or  --II  option,  this
              will  cause  the pattern to match without regards to the case of
              each letter.


       ----mmaattcchhddiirrss
              If a match pattern is specified by  the  --PP  option,  this  will
              cause  the pattern to be applied to directory names (in addition
              to filenames).  In the event of a match on the  directory  name,
              matching  is  disabled  for  the  directory's  contents.  If the
              ----pprruunnee option is used, empty folders  that  match  the  pattern
              will not be pruned.


       ----pprruunnee
              Makes  tree prune empty directories from the output, useful when
              used in conjunction with --PP or --II.  See BBUUGGSS AANNDD NNOOTTEESS below for
              more information on this option.


       ----nnoorreeppoorrtt
              Omits  printing  of  the file and directory report at the end of
              the tree listing.


       ----cchhaarrsseett _c_h_a_r_s_e_t
              Set the character set to use when outputting HTML and  for  line
              drawing.


       ----ffiilleelliimmiitt _#
              Do not descend directories that contain more than _# entries.


       ----ttiimmeeffmmtt _f_o_r_m_a_t
              Prints (implies -D) and formats the date according to the format
              string which uses the ssttrrffttiimmee(3) syntax.


       --oo _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Send output to _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.



FFIILLEE OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --qq     Print non-printable characters in filenames  as  question  marks
              instead of the default.


       --NN     Print non-printable characters as is instead of as escaped octal
              numbers.


       --QQ     Quote the names of files in double quotes.


       --pp     Print the file type and permissions for each  file  (as  per  ls
              -l).


       --uu     Print the username, or UID # if no username is available, of the
              file.


       --gg     Print the group name, or GID # if no group name is available, of
              the file.


       --ss     Print the size of each file in bytes along with the name.


       --hh     Print  the  size  of each file but in a more human readable way,
              e.g. appending a size letter for kilobytes (K),  megabytes  (M),
              gigabytes (G), terabytes (T), petabytes (P) and exabytes (E).


       ----ssii   Like --hh but use SI units (powers of 1000) instead.


       ----dduu   For  each directory report its size as the accumulation of sizes
              of all its files and sub-directories (and their  files,  and  so
              on).   The total amount of used space is also given in the final
              report (like the 'du -c' command.) This option requires tree  to
              read  the entire directory tree before emitting it, see BBUUGGSS AANNDD
              NNOOTTEESS below.  Implies --ss.


       --DD     Print the date of the last modification time or if --cc  is  used,
              the last status change time for the file listed.


       --FF     Append  a `/' for directories, a `=' for socket files, a `*' for
              executable files, a `>'  for  doors  (Solaris)  and  a  `|'  for
              FIFO's, as per ls -F


       ----iinnooddeess
              Prints the inode number of the file or directory


       ----ddeevviiccee
              Prints the device number to which the file or directory belongs



SSOORRTTIINNGG OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --vv     Sort the output by version.


       --tt     Sort  the output by last modification time instead of alphabeti-
              cally.


       --cc     Sort the output by last status change instead of alphabetically.
              Modifies the --DD option (if used) to print the last status change
              instead of modification time.


       --UU     Do not sort.  Lists files in directory order.  Disables  ----ddiirrss--

       --rr     Sort  the  output  in  reverse  order.  This is a meta-sort that
              alter the above sorts.  This option is disabled when --UU is used.


       ----ddiirrssffiirrsstt
              List  directories  before files. This is a meta-sort that alters
              the above sorts.  This option is disabled when --UU is used.


       ----ssoorrtt[==]_t_y_p_e
              Sort the output by _t_y_p_e instead of name.  Possible  values  are:
              ccttiimmee (--cc), mmttiimmee (--tt)),, ssiizzee, or vveerrssiioonn (--vv))..


GGRRAAPPHHIICCSS OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --ii     Makes  tree not print the indentation lines, useful when used in
              conjunction with the --ff option.  Also removes as much whitespace
              as possible when used with the --JJ or --xx options.


       --AA     Turn  on  ANSI  line graphics hack when printing the indentation
              lines.


       --SS     Turn on CP437 line graphics (useful  when  using  Linux  console
              mode fonts). This option is now equivalent to `--charset=IBM437'
              and may eventually be depreciated.


       --nn     Turn colorization off always, over-ridden by the --CC option.


       --CC     Turn colorization on always, using built-in  color  defaults  if
              the  LS_COLORS or TREE_COLORS environment variables are not set.
              Useful to colorize output to a pipe.

       --XX     Turn on XML output. Outputs the directory tree as an XML format-
              ted file.


       --JJ     Turn  on JSON output. Outputs the directory tree as an JSON for-
              matted array.


       --HH _b_a_s_e_H_R_E_F
              Turn on HTML output, including HTTP references. Useful  for  ftp
              sites.   _b_a_s_e_H_R_E_F  gives  the  base ftp location when using HTML
              output. That is, the local directory  may  be  `/local/ftp/pub',
              but   it   must   be   referenced  as  `ftp://hostname.organiza-
              tion.domain/pub' (_b_a_s_e_H_R_E_F should  be  `ftp://hostname.organiza-
              tion.domain').  Hint: don't use ANSI lines with this option, and
              don't give more than one directory in the directory list. If you
              wish  to  use  colors  via CSS style-sheet, use the -C option in
              addition to this option to force color output.


       --TT _t_i_t_l_e
              Sets the title and H1 header string in HTML output mode.

       Tree does not prune ""empty"" directories when the -P and -I options  are
       used by default. Use the --prune option.

       The -h and --si options round to the nearest whole number unlike the ls
       implementations which rounds up always.

       Pruning files and directories with the -I, -P and  --filelimit  options
       will lead to incorrect file/directory count reports.

       The  --prune  and --du options cause tree to accumulate the entire tree
       in memory before emitting it. For large directory trees this can  cause
       a significant delay in output and the use of large amounts of memory.

       The  timefmt  expansion  buffer  is limited to a ridiculously large 255
       characters.  Output of time strings longer than this will be undefined,
       but are guaranteed to not exceed 255 characters.

       XML/JSON trees are not colored, which is a bit of a shame.

       Probably more.

     The cchhppaassss utility allows editing of the user database information asso-
     ciated with _u_s_e_r or, by default, the current user.

     The cchhppaassss utility _c_a_n_n_o_t change the user's password on Open Directory
     systems.  Use the passwd(1) utility instead.

     The cchhffnn, and cchhsshh utilities behave identically to cchhppaassss.  (There is
     only one program.)

     The information is formatted and supplied to an editor for changes.

     Only the information that the user is allowed to change is displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     --ll _l_o_c_a_t_i_o_n
             If not specified, cchhppaassss will perform a search for the user
             record on all available Open Directory nodes.  When specified,
             cchhppaassss will edit the user record on the directory node at the
             given _l_o_c_a_t_i_o_n.

     --uu _a_u_t_h_n_a_m_e
             The user name to use when authenticating to the directory node
             containing the user.

     --ss _n_e_w_s_h_e_l_l
             Attempt to change the user's shell to _n_e_w_s_h_e_l_l.

     Possible display items are as follows:

           Login:              user's login name
           Uid:                user's login
           Gid:                user's login group
           Generated uid:      user's UUID
           Full Name:          user's real name
           Office Location:    user's office location
           Office Phone:       user's office phone
           Home Phone:         user's home phone
           Home Directory:     user's home directory
           Shell:              user's login shell

     The _l_o_g_i_n field is the user name used to access the computer account.

     The _u_i_d field is the number associated with the _l_o_g_i_n field.  Both of
     these fields should be unique across the system (and often across a group
     of systems) as they control file access.

     While it is possible to have multiple entries with identical login names
     and/or identical user id's, it is usually a mistake to do so.  Routines
     that manipulate these files will often return only one of the multiple
     entries, and that one by random selection.

     The _g_r_o_u_p field is the group that the user will be placed in at login.
     Since BSD supports multiple groups (see groups(1)) this field currently
     has little special meaning.  This field may be filled in with either a
     number or a group name (see group(5)).

     The _g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e_d _u_i_d field is the globally unique identifier (UUID) for the
     user.  The _f_u_l_l _n_a_m_e field contains the full name of the user.

     The user's _h_o_m_e _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is the full UNIX path name where the user will
     be placed at login.

     The _s_h_e_l_l field is the command interpreter the user prefers.  If the
     _s_h_e_l_l field is empty, the Bourne shell, _/_b_i_n_/_s_h, is assumed.  When alter-
     ing a login shell, and not the super-user, the user may not change from a
     non-standard shell or to a non-standard shell.  Non-standard is defined
     as a shell not found in _/_e_t_c_/_s_h_e_l_l_s.

     The _p_i_c_t_u_r_e field is the path to a picture to be displayed for the user.

     User database entries are under the control of DirectoryService(8) and
     may be physically located in many different places, including the local
     Directory Service node, and remote LDAP servers.  This version of cchhppaassss
     uses Open Directory to change user database information.  It does not
     interact with the historic flat file database _/_e_t_c_/_m_a_s_t_e_r_._p_a_s_s_w_d

     or the super-user, may edit the information associated with the user.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The sshhuuttddoowwnn utility provides an automated shutdown procedure for super-
     users to nicely notify users when the system is shutting down, saving
     them from system administrators, hackers, and gurus, who would otherwise
     not bother with such niceties.

     The following options are available:

     --hh      The system is halted at the specified _t_i_m_e.

     --kk      Kick everybody off.  The --kk option does not actually halt the
             system, but leaves the system multi-user with logins disabled
             (for all but super-user).

     --nn      If the --oo is specified, prevent the file system cache from being
             flushed by passing --nn option to halt(8) or reboot(8).  This
             option should probably not be used.

     --oo      If --hh or --rr is specified, sshhuuttddoowwnn will execute halt(8) or
             reboot(8) instead of sending a signal to launchd(8).

     --rr      The system is rebooted at the specified _t_i_m_e.

     --ss      The system is put to sleep at the specified _t_i_m_e.

     --uu      The system is halted up until the point of removing system power,
             but waits before removing power for 5 minutes so that an external
             UPS (uninterruptible power supply) can forcibly remove power.
             This simulates a dirty shutdown to permit a later automatic power
             on. OS X uses this mode automatically with supported UPSs in
             emergency shutdowns.

     _t_i_m_e    _T_i_m_e is the time at which sshhuuttddoowwnn will bring the system down and
             may be the word _n_o_w (indicating an immediate shutdown) or specify
             a future time in one of two formats: _+_n_u_m_b_e_r, or _y_y_m_m_d_d_h_h_m_m,
             where the year, month, and day may be defaulted to the current
             system values.  The first form brings the system down in _n_u_m_b_e_r
             minutes and the second at the absolute time specified.

     _w_a_r_n_i_n_g_-_m_e_s_s_a_g_e
             Any other arguments comprise the warning message that is broad-
             cast to users currently logged into the system.

     --       If `--' is supplied as an option, the warning message is read from
             the standard input.

     At intervals, becoming more frequent as apocalypse approaches and start-
     ing at ten hours before shutdown, warning messages are displayed on the
     terminals of all users logged in.

     At shutdown time a message is written to the system log, containing the
     time of shutdown, the person who initiated the shutdown and the reason.
     Corresponding signal is then sent to launchd(8) to respectively halt,
     reboot or bring the system down to single-user state (depending on the
     above options).

     A scheduled shutdown can be canceled by killing the sshhuuttddoowwnn process (a
     SIGTERM should suffice).

SSIIGGTTEERRMM TTOO SSIIGGKKIILLLL IINNTTEERRVVAALL
     Upon shutdown, all running processes are sent a SIGTERM followed by a
     SIGKILL.  The SIGKILL will follow the SIGTERM by an intentionally inde-
     terminate period of time.  Programs are expected to take only enough time
     to flush all dirty data and exit.  Developers are encouraged to file a
     bug with the OS vendor, should they encounter an issue with this func-
     tionality.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The uull utility reads the named files (or standard input if none are
     given) and translates occurrences of underscores to the sequence which
     indicates underlining for the terminal in use, as specified by the envi-
     ronment variable TERM.  The file _/_e_t_c_/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p is read to determine the
     appropriate sequences for underlining.  If the terminal is incapable of
     underlining, but is capable of a standout mode then that is used instead.
     If the terminal can overstrike, or handles underlining automatically, uull
     degenerates to cat(1).  If the terminal cannot underline, underlining is
     ignored.

     The following options are available:

     --ii      Underlining is indicated by a separate line containing appropri-
             ate dashes `-'; this is useful when you want to look at the
             underlining which is present in an nroff(1) output stream on a

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The aatt and bbaattcchh utilities read commands from standard input or a speci-
     fied file.  The commands are executed at a later time, using sh(1).

     aatt      executes commands at a specified time;

     aattqq     lists the user's pending jobs, unless the user is the superuser;
             in that case, everybody's jobs are listed;

     aattrrmm    deletes jobs;

     bbaattcchh   executes commands when system load levels permit; in other words,
             when the load average drops below _LOADAVG_MX (1.5), or the value
             specified in the invocation of aattrruunn.

     The aatt utility allows some moderately complex _t_i_m_e specifications.  It
     accepts times of the form _H_H_M_M or _H_H_:_M_M to run a job at a specific time
     of day.  (If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.)  As an
     alternative, the following keywords may be specified: _m_i_d_n_i_g_h_t, _n_o_o_n, or
     _t_e_a_t_i_m_e (4pm) and time-of-day may be suffixed with _A_M or _P_M for running
     in the morning or the evening.  The day on which the job is to be run may
     also be specified by giving a date in the form _m_o_n_t_h_-_n_a_m_e _d_a_y with an
     optional _y_e_a_r, or giving a date of the forms _D_D_._M_M_._Y_Y_Y_Y, _D_D_._M_M_._Y_Y,
     _M_M_/_D_D_/_Y_Y_Y_Y, _M_M_/_D_D_/_Y_Y, _M_M_D_D_Y_Y_Y_Y, _o_r _M_M_D_D_Y_Y.  The specification of a date
     must follow the specification of the time of day.  Time can also be spec-
     ified as: [_n_o_w] _+ _c_o_u_n_t _t_i_m_e_-_u_n_i_t_s, where the time-units can be _m_i_n_u_t_e_s,
     _h_o_u_r_s, _d_a_y_s, _w_e_e_k_s, _m_o_n_t_h_s or _y_e_a_r_s and aatt may be told to run the job
     today by suffixing the time with _t_o_d_a_y and to run the job tomorrow by
     suffixing the time with _t_o_m_o_r_r_o_w.  The shortcut _n_e_x_t can be used instead
     of _+ _1.

     For example, to run a job at 4pm three days from now, use aatt _4_p_m _+ _3
     _d_a_y_s, to run a job at 10:00am on July 31, use aatt _1_0_a_m _J_u_l _3_1 and to run a
     job at 1am tomorrow, use aatt _1_a_m _t_o_m_o_r_r_o_w.

     The aatt utility also supports the POSIX time format (see --tt option).

     For both aatt and bbaattcchh, commands are read from standard input or the file
     specified with the --ff option.  The working directory, the environment
     (except for the variables TERM, TERMCAP, DISPLAY and __), and the _u_m_a_s_k
     are retained from the time of invocation.  An aatt or bbaattcchh command invoked
     from a su(1) shell will retain the current userid.  The user will be
     mailed standard error and standard output from his commands, if any.
     Mail will be sent using the command sendmail(8).  If aatt is executed from
     a su(1) shell, the owner of the login shell will receive the mail.

     The superuser may use these commands in any case.  For other users, per-
     mission to use aatt is determined by the files ___P_E_R_M___P_A_T_H_/_a_t_._a_l_l_o_w and
     ___P_E_R_M___P_A_T_H_/_a_t_._d_e_n_y.

     If the file ___P_E_R_M___P_A_T_H_/_a_t_._a_l_l_o_w exists, only usernames mentioned in it
     are allowed to use aatt.  In these two files, a user is considered to be
     listed only if the user name has no blank or other characters before it
     on its line and a newline character immediately after the name, even at
     the end of the file.  Other lines are ignored and may be used for com-
     ments.

     If ___P_E_R_M___P_A_T_H_/_a_t_._a_l_l_o_w does not exist, ___P_E_R_M___P_A_T_H_/_a_t_._d_e_n_y is checked,
     every username not mentioned in it is then allowed to use aatt.

     If neither exists, only the superuser is allowed use of aatt.

     Note that aatt is implemented through the launchd(8) daemon periodically
     invoking atrun(8), which is disabled by default.  See atrun(8) for infor-

             was no output.

     --qq _q_u_e_u_e
             Use the specified queue.  A queue designation consists of a sin-
             gle letter; valid queue designations range from _a to _z and _A to
             _Z.  The ___D_E_F_A_U_L_T___A_T___Q_U_E_U_E queue (a) is the default for aatt and the
             ___D_E_F_A_U_L_T___B_A_T_C_H___Q_U_E_U_E queue (b) is the default for bbaattcchh.  Queues
             with higher letters run with increased niceness.  If a job is
             submitted to a queue designated with an uppercase letter, it is
             treated as if it had been submitted to batch at that time.  If
             aattqq is given a specific queue, it will only show jobs pending in
             that queue.

     --rr      Remove the specified jobs.

     --tt      Specify the job time using the POSIX time format.  The argument
             should be in the form [[_C_C]_Y_Y]_M_M_D_D_h_h_m_m[._S_S] where each pair of
             letters represents the following:

                   _C_C      The first two digits of the year (the century).
                   _Y_Y      The second two digits of the year.
                   _M_M      The month of the year, from 1 to 12.
                   _D_D      the day of the month, from 1 to 31.
                   _h_h      The hour of the day, from 0 to 23.
                   _m_m      The minute of the hour, from 0 to 59.
                   _S_S      The second of the minute, from 0 to 61.

             If the _C_C and _Y_Y letter pairs are not specified, the values
             default to the current year.  If the _S_S letter pair is not speci-
             fied, the value defaults to 0.

     --vv      For aattqq, shows completed but not yet deleted jobs in the queue;

     userid found in the environment variable LOGNAME.  If that is undefined
     or empty, the current userid is assumed.

     The aatt and bbaattcchh utilities as presently implemented are not suitable when
     users are competing for resources.  If this is the case, another batch

       This  command  is  reserved  for the superuser. To submit mail, use the
       Postfix sseennddmmaaiill(1) command.

       The ppoossttffiixx(1) command controls the operation of the Postfix mail  sys-
       tem:  start  or stop the mmaasstteerr(8) daemon, do a health check, and other
       maintenance.

       By default, the ppoossttffiixx(1) command sets up a  standardized  environment
       and runs the ppoossttffiixx--ssccrriipptt shell script to do the actual work.

       However,  when  support  for  multiple Postfix instances is configured,
       ppoossttffiixx(1) executes the command specified with the mmuullttii__iinnssttaannccee__wwrraapp--
       ppeerr configuration parameter.  This command will execute the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d for
       each applicable Postfix instance.

       The following commands are implemented:

       cchheecckk  Warn about bad directory/file ownership or permissions, and cre-
              ate missing directories.

       ssttaarrtt  Start  the Postfix mail system. This also runs the configuration
              check described above.

       ssttoopp   Stop the Postfix mail system in an orderly fashion. If possible,
              running  processes  are  allowed  to terminate at their earliest
              convenience.

              Note: in order to refresh the Postfix mail system after  a  con-
              figuration  change,  do  not  use the ssttaarrtt and ssttoopp commands in
              succession. Use the rreellooaadd command instead.

       fflluusshh  Force delivery: attempt to deliver every message in the deferred

       The following options are implemented:

       --cc _c_o_n_f_i_g___d_i_r
              Read  the mmaaiinn..ccff and mmaasstteerr..ccff configuration files in the named
              directory instead of the default configuration  directory.   Use
              this  to  distinguish  between multiple Postfix instances on the
              same host.

              With Postfix 2.6 and later, this option  forces  the  postfix(1)
              command to operate on the specified Postfix instance only.  This
              behavior is inherited by  postfix(1)  commands  that  run  as  a
              descendant of the current process.

       --DD (with ppoossttffiixx ssttaarrtt only)

              via the ddeebbuuggggeerr__ccoommmmaanndd configuration parameter.

       --vv     Enable verbose  logging  for  debugging  purposes.  Multiple  --vv
              options make the software increasingly verbose.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       The  ppoossttffiixx(1)  command  exports  the  following environment variables

       MMAAIILL__CCOONNFFIIGG
              This is set when the -c command-line option is present.

              With Postfix 2.6 and later, this environment variable forces the
              postfix(1)  command to operate on the specified Postfix instance
              only.  This behavior is inherited by  postfix(1)  commands  that
              run as a descendant of the current process.

       MMAAIILL__VVEERRBBOOSSEE
              This is set when the -v command-line option is present.

     The ttoopp program periodically displays a sorted list of system processes.
     The default sorting key is pid, but other keys can be used instead.  Var-
     ious output options are available.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     Command line option specifications are processed from left to right.
     Options can be specified more than once.  If conflicting options are
     specified, later specifications override earlier ones.  This makes it
     viable to create a shell alias for ttoopp with preferred defaults specified,
     then override those preferred defaults as desired on the command line.

     --cc _m_o_d_e
             Set event counting mode to _m_o_d_e.  The supported modes are

             a       Accumulative mode.  Count events cumulatively, starting
                     at the launch of ttoopp.  Calculate CPU usage and CPU time
                     since the launch of ttoopp.

             d       Delta mode.  Count events relative to the previous sam-
                     ple.  Calculate CPU usage since the previous sample.
                     This mode by default disables the memory object map
                     reporting.  The memory object map reporting may be re-
                     enabled with the --rr option or the interactive rr command.

             e       Absolute mode.  Count events using absolute counters.

             Use logging mode and display _s_a_m_p_l_e_s samples, even if standard
             output is a terminal.  0 is treated as infinity.  Rather than
             redisplaying, output is periodically printed in raw form.  Note
             that the first sample displayed will have an invalid %CPU dis-
             played for each process, as it is calculated using the delta
             between samples.

DDIISSPPLLAAYY
     The first several lines of the ttoopp display show various global state.
     All of the information is labeled.  Following is an alphabetical list of
     global state fields and their descriptions.

     CPU         Percentage of processor usage, broken into user, system, and
                 idle components.  The time period for which these percentages
                 are calculated depends on the event counting mode.

     Disks       Number and total size of disk reads and writes.

     LoadAvg     Load average over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.  The load average is
                 the average number of jobs in the run queue.

     MemRegions  Number and total size of memory regions, and total size of
                 memory regions broken into private (broken into non-library
                 and library) and shared components.

     Networks    Number and total size of input and output network packets.

     PhysMem     Physical memory usage, broken into wired, active, inactive,
                 used, and free components.

     Procs       Total number of processes and number of processes in each
                 process state.

     SharedLibs  Resident sizes of code and data segments, and link editor
                 memory usage.

     Threads     Number of threads.

     Time        Time, in H:MM:SS format.  When running in logging mode, Time
                 is in YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS format by default, but may be over-
                 ridden with accumulative mode.  When running in accumulative
                 event counting mode, the Time is in HH:MM:SS since the begin-
                 ning of the ttoopp process.

     VirtMem     Total virtual memory, virtual memory consumed by shared
                 libraries, and number of pageins and pageouts.

     Swap        Swap usage: total size of swap areas, amount of swap space in
                 use and amount of swap space available.

     Purgeable   Number of pages purged and number of pages currently purge-
                 able.

     Below the global state fields, a list of processes is displayed.  The
     fields that are displayed depend on the options that are set.  The pid
     field displays the following for the architecture:

     + for 64-bit native architecture, or - for 32-bit native architecture, or
     * for a non-native architecture.

IINNTTEERRAACCTTIIOONN
     When ttoopp is run in interactive (non-logging) mode, it is possible to con-
     trol the output of ttoopp, as well as interactively send signals to pro-
     cesses.  The interactive command syntax is terse.  Each command is one
     character, followed by 0 to 2 arguments.  Commands that take arguments
     prompt interactively for the arguments, and where applicable, the default
     value is shown in square brackets.  The default value can be selected by
     leaving the input field blank and pressing enter.  ^G escapes the inter-
     active argument prompt, and has the same effect as leaving the input
     field blank and pressing enter.

     The following commands are supported:

     ?       Display the help screen.  Any character exits help screen mode.
             This command always works, even in the middle of a command.

     ^L      Redraw the screen.

     c_m_o_d_e   Set output mode to _m_o_d_e.  See the --cc option for descriptions of
             the allowed modes.

     O_s_k_e_y   Use _s_k_e_y as a secondary key when ordering the process display.
             See the --oo option for key names.

     o_k_e_y    Order the process display by sorting on _k_e_y in descending order.
             A + or - can be prefixed to the key name to specify ascending or
             descending order, respectively.  The supported keys and alises
             are listed with the --oo option above.

     q       Quit.

     r       Toggle traversal and reporting of the memory object map for each
             process.

     S_s_i_g_n_a_l_p_i_d
             Send signal _s_i_g_n_a_l to _p_i_d.  _s_i_g_n_a_l can be specified either as a
             number or as a name (for example, HUP).  The default signal
             starts out as TERM.  Each time a signal is successfully sent, the
             default signal is updated to be that signal.  _p_i_d is a process
             id.

     s _d_e_l_a_y_-_s_e_c_s

     Calculating detailed memory statistics is fundamentally resource-inten-
     sive.  To reduce the CPU usage in ttoopp, the --ii option has been introduced
     to allow the user to tune this tradeoff.  With the default value of 10,
     framework stats will be updated once every 10 samples.  Specifying --ii _1
     will result in the most accurate display, at the expense of system
     resources.

     When N/A occurs in a stat, it's caused by the memory object map reporting
     being disabled.  Memory object map reporting is disabled by default in
     delta mode, but may be optionally enabled via --rr or the interactive rr
     command.  To enable the --rr option, use it after any --cc mode options.

             Sort the processes according to CPU usage (descending) and resi-
             dent memory size (ascending), sample and update the display at 5
             second intervals, and limit the display to 20 processes.

     top -c d

             Display only the specified statistics, regardless of any growth
             of the terminal.  If the terminal is too small, only the statis-
             tics that fit will be displayed.

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

     llaassttccoommmm gives information on previously executed commands.  With no
     arguments, llaassttccoommmm prints information about all the commands recorded
     during the current accounting file's lifetime.

     Option:

     --ff _f_i_l_e     Read from _f_i_l_e rather than the default accounting file.

     If called with arguments, only accounting entries with a matching _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
     name, _u_s_e_r name, or _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l name are printed.  So, for example:

           lastcomm a.out root ttyd0

     user _r_o_o_t on the terminal _t_t_y_d_0.

     For each process entry, the following are printed.

           ++oo   The name of the user who ran the process.
           ++oo   Flags, as accumulated by the accounting facilities in the sys-

           ++oo   The elapsed time of the process.

     The flags are encoded as follows: ``S'' indicates the command was exe-

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     In the first synopsis form, the ccpp utility copies the contents of the
     _s_o_u_r_c_e___f_i_l_e to the _t_a_r_g_e_t___f_i_l_e.  In the second synopsis form, the con-
     tents of each named _s_o_u_r_c_e___f_i_l_e is copied to the destination
     _t_a_r_g_e_t___d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.  The names of the files themselves are not changed.  If
     ccpp detects an attempt to copy a file to itself, the copy will fail.

     The following options are available:

     --aa    Same as --ppPPRR options. Preserves structure and attributes of files
           but not directory structure.

     --ff    If the destination file cannot be opened, remove it and create a
           new file, without prompting for confirmation regardless of its per-
           missions.  (The --ff option overrides any previous --nn option.)

           The target file is not unlinked before the copy.  Thus, any exist-
           ing access rights will be retained.

     --HH    If the --RR option is specified, symbolic links on the command line
           are followed.  (Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal
           are not followed.)

     --ii    Cause ccpp to write a prompt to the standard error output before
           copying a file that would overwrite an existing file.  If the
           response from the standard input begins with the character `y' or
           `Y', the file copy is attempted.  (The --ii option overrides any pre-
           vious --nn option.)

     --LL    If the --RR option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.

     --nn    Do not overwrite an existing file.  (The --nn option overrides any
           previous --ff or --ii options.)

     --PP    If the --RR option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
           This is the default.

     --pp    Cause ccpp to preserve the following attributes of each source file
           in the copy: modification time, access time, file flags, file mode,
           user ID, and group ID, as allowed by permissions.  Access Control
           Lists (ACLs) and Extended Attributes (EAs), including resource
           forks, will also be preserved.

           If the user ID and group ID cannot be preserved, no error message
           is displayed and the exit value is not altered.

           If the source file has its set-user-ID bit on and the user ID can-
           not be preserved, the set-user-ID bit is not preserved in the
           copy's permissions.  If the source file has its set-group-ID bit on
           and the group ID cannot be preserved, the set-group-ID bit is not
           preserved in the copy's permissions.  If the source file has both
           its set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits on, and either the user ID or
           group ID cannot be preserved, neither the set-user-ID nor set-
           group-ID bits are preserved in the copy's permissions.

     --RR    If _s_o_u_r_c_e___f_i_l_e designates a directory, ccpp copies the directory and
           the entire subtree connected at that point.  If the _s_o_u_r_c_e___f_i_l_e
           ends in a _/, the contents of the directory are copied rather than
           the directory itself.  This option also causes symbolic links to be
           copied, rather than indirected through, and for ccpp to create spe-
           cial files rather than copying them as normal files.  Created
           directories have the same mode as the corresponding source direc-
           tory, unmodified by the process' umask.

           In --RR mode, ccpp will continue copying even if errors are detected.

           Note that ccpp copies hard-linked files as separate files.  If you
           need to preserve hard links, consider using tar(1), cpio(1), or
           pax(1) instead.

     --vv    Cause ccpp to be verbose, showing files as they are copied.

     --XX    Do not copy Extended Attributes (EAs) or resource forks.

     --cc    copy files using clonefile(2)

     For each destination file that already exists, its contents are overwrit-
     ten if permissions allow.  Its mode, user ID, and group ID are unchanged
     unless the --pp option was specified.

     In the second synopsis form, _t_a_r_g_e_t___d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y must exist unless there is
     only one named _s_o_u_r_c_e___f_i_l_e which is a directory and the --RR flag is speci-
     fied.

     If the destination file does not exist, the mode of the source file is
     used as modified by the file mode creation mask (uummaasskk, see csh(1)).  If
     the source file has its set-user-ID bit on, that bit is removed unless
     both the source file and the destination file are owned by the same user.
     If the source file has its set-group-ID bit on, that bit is removed
     unless both the source file and the destination file are in the same
     group and the user is a member of that group.  If both the set-user-ID
     and set-group-ID bits are set, all of the above conditions must be ful-
     filled or both bits are removed.

     Appropriate permissions are required for file creation or overwriting.

     Symbolic links are always followed unless the --RR flag is set, in which
     case symbolic links are not followed, by default.  The --HH or --LL flags (in
     conjunction with the --RR flag) cause symbolic links to be followed as
     described above.  The --HH, --LL and --PP options are ignored unless the --RR
     option is specified.  In addition, these options override each other and
     the command's actions are determined by the last one specified.

     If ccpp receives a SIGINFO (see the ssttaattuuss argument for stty(1)) signal,
     the current input and output file and the percentage complete will be
     written to the standard output.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
     The ccpp utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
     Historic versions of the ccpp utility had a --rr option.  This implementation
     supports that option; however, its use is strongly discouraged, as it
     does not correctly copy special files, symbolic links, or fifo's.

     The --vv and --nn options are non-standard and their use in scripts is not
     recommended.

LLEEGGAACCYY DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     In legacy mode, --ff will override --ii.  Also, under the --ff option, the tar-
     get file is always unlinked before the copy.  Thus, new access rights
     will always be set.

     In --RR mode, copying will terminate if an error is encountered.

     The ccaall utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format and nnccaall
     offers an alternative layout, more options and the date of Easter.  The
     new format is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25x80 termi-
     nal.  If arguments are not specified, the current month is displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     --hh      Turns off highlighting of today.

     --JJ      Display Julian Calendar, if combined with the --ee option, display
             date of Easter according to the Julian Calendar.

     --ee      Display date of Easter (for western churches).

     --jj      Display Julian days (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

     --mm _m_o_n_t_h
             Display the specified _m_o_n_t_h.  If _m_o_n_t_h is specified as a decimal
             number, it may be followed by the letter `f' or `p' to indicate
             the following or preceding month of that number, respectively.

     --oo      Display date of Orthodox Easter (Greek and Russian Orthodox
             Churches).

     --pp      Print the country codes and switching days from Julian to Grego-
             rian Calendar as they are assumed by nnccaall.  The country code as
             determined from the local environment is marked with an asterisk.

     --ss _c_o_u_n_t_r_y___c_o_d_e
             Assume the switch from Julian to Gregorian Calendar at the date
             associated with the _c_o_u_n_t_r_y___c_o_d_e.  If not specified, nnccaall tries
             to guess the switch date from the local environment or falls back
             to September 2, 1752.  This was when Great Britain and her
             colonies switched to the Gregorian Calendar.

     --ww      Print the number of the week below each week column.

     --yy      Display a calendar for the specified year.

     --33      Display the previous, current and next month surrounding today.

     --AA _n_u_m_b_e_r
             Display the _n_u_m_b_e_r of months after the current month.

     --BB _n_u_m_b_e_r
             Display the _n_u_m_b_e_r of months before the current month.

     --CC      Switch to ccaall mode.

     --NN      Switch to nnccaall mode.

     --dd _y_y_y_y_-_m_m
             Use _y_y_y_y_-_m_m as the current date (for debugging of date selec-
             tion).

     --HH _y_y_y_y_-_m_m_-_d_d
             Use _y_y_y_y_-_m_m_-_d_d as the current date (for debugging of highlight-
             ing).

     A single parameter specifies the year (1-9999) to be displayed; note the
     year must be fully specified: ``cal 89'' will _n_o_t display a calendar for
     1989.  Two parameters denote the month and year; the month is either a
     number between 1 and 12, or a full or abbreviated name as specified by
     the current locale.  Month and year default to those of the current sys-
     tem clock and time zone (so ``cal -m 8'' will display a calendar for the
     month of August in the current year).

     Not all options can be used together. For example ``-3 -A 2 -B 3 -y -m
     7'' would mean: show me the three months around the seventh month, three
     before that, two after that and the whole year.  nnccaall will warn about
     these combinations.

     A year starts on January 1.

     Highlighting of dates is disabled if stdout is not a tty.

     The assignment of Julian-Gregorian switching dates to country codes is
     historically naive for many countries.

     Not all options are compatible and using them in different orders will
     give varying results.

       ttppuutt --SS  <<<<
       ttppuutt --VV

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  ttppuutt utility uses the tteerrmmiinnffoo database to make the values of ter-
       minal-dependent capabilities and information  available  to  the  shell
       (see  sshh(1)),  to  initialize or reset the terminal, or return the long
       name of the requested terminal type.  The result depends upon the capa-
       bility's type:

              string
                   ttppuutt writes the string to the standard output.  No trailing
                   newline is supplied.

              integer
                   ttppuutt writes the decimal value to the standard output,  with
                   a trailing newline.

              boolean
                   ttppuutt  simply sets the exit code (00 for TRUE if the terminal
                   has the capability, 11 for FALSE if it does not), and writes
                   nothing to the standard output.

       Before  using  a value returned on the standard output, the application
       should test the exit code (e.g., $$??, see sshh(1)) to be  sure  it  is  00.
       (See  the EEXXIITT CCOODDEESS and DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS sections.)  For a complete list of
       capabilities and the _c_a_p_n_a_m_e associated with each, see tteerrmmiinnffoo(5).

       --TT_t_y_p_e indicates the _t_y_p_e of terminal.  Normally this option is  unnec-
              essary,  because the default is taken from the environment vari-
              able TTEERRMM.  If --TT is specified, then the shell  variables  LLIINNEESS
              and CCOOLLUUMMNNSS will be ignored,and the operating system will not be
              queried for the actual screen size.

       _c_a_p_n_a_m_e
              indicates the capability from the tteerrmmiinnffoo database.  When tteerrmm--
              ccaapp  support is compiled in, the tteerrmmccaapp name for the capability
              is also accepted.

       _p_a_r_m_s  If the capability is a string that takes parameters,  the  argu-
              ments _p_a_r_m_s will be instantiated into the string.

              Most  parameters  are numbers.  Only a few terminfo capabilities
              require string parameters; ttppuutt uses a table to decide which  to
              pass  as  strings.  Normally ttppuutt uses ttppaarrmm (3X) to perform the
              substitution.  If no parameters are given  for  the  capability,
              ttppuutt writes the string without performing the substitution.

       --SS     allows  more  than  one  capability per invocation of ttppuutt.  The
              capabilities must be passed to  ttppuutt  from  the  standard  input
              instead  of  from the command line (see example).  Only one _c_a_p_-
              _n_a_m_e is allowed per line.  The --SS option changes the meaning  of
              the  00  and  11 boolean and string exit codes (see the EXIT CODES
              section).

              Again, ttppuutt uses a table and the presence of parameters  in  its
              input  to decide whether to use ttppaarrmm (3X), and how to interpret
              the parameters.

       --VV     reports the version of ncurses which was used in  this  program,
              and exits.

       iinniitt   If  the tteerrmmiinnffoo database is present and an entry for the user's
              terminal exists (see --TT_t_y_p_e, above), the following will occur:

              (1)    if present, the terminal's initialization strings will be
                     output as detailed in the tteerrmmiinnffoo(5) section on _T_a_b_s _a_n_d
                     _I_n_i_t_i_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n,

              (2)    any delays (e.g., newline) specified in the entry will be
                     set in the tty driver,

              (3)    tabs  expansion will be turned on or off according to the
                     specification in the entry, and

              (4)    if tabs are not  expanded,  standard  tabs  will  be  set
                     (every 8 spaces).

              If  an  entry does not contain the information needed for any of
              the four  above  activities,  that  activity  will  silently  be
              skipped.

       rreesseett  Instead  of  putting  out initialization strings, the terminal's
              reset strings will be output if present (rrss11, rrss22, rrss33, rrff).  If
              the  reset  strings  are not present, but initialization strings
              are, the initialization  strings  will  be  output.   Otherwise,
              rreesseett acts identically to iinniitt.

       lloonnggnnaammee
              If  the tteerrmmiinnffoo database is present and an entry for the user's
              terminal exists (see --TT_t_y_p_e above), then the long  name  of  the
              terminal will be put out.  The long name is the last name in the
              first line of the terminal's description in the  tteerrmmiinnffoo  data-
              base [see tteerrmm(5)].

       If  ttppuutt  is invoked by a link named rreesseett, this has the same effect as
       ttppuutt rreesseett.  See ttsseett for comparison, which has similar behavior.

            Initialize the terminal according to the type of terminal  in  the

            exported, as illustrated on the pprrooffiillee(5) manual page.

            This example shows ttppuutt processing  several  capabilities  in  one
            invocation.   It  clears  the screen, moves the cursor to position
            10, 10 and turns on bold (extra bright) mode.  The list is  termi-
            nated by an exclamation mark (!!) on a line by itself.

       If the --SS option is used, ttppuutt checks for errors from each line, and if
       any  errors  are  found, will set the exit code to 4 plus the number of
       lines with errors.  If no errors are found, the exit  code  is  00.   No
       indication  of which line failed can be given so exit code 11 will never
       appear.  Exit codes 22, 33, and 44 retain their usual interpretation.   If
       the  --SS  option  is not used, the exit code depends on the type of _c_a_p_-
       _n_a_m_e:

            _b_o_o_l_e_a_n
                   a value of 00 is set for TRUE and 11 for FALSE.

            _s_t_r_i_n_g a value of 00 is set if the _c_a_p_n_a_m_e is defined for this ter-
                   minal  _t_y_p_e  (the  value of _c_a_p_n_a_m_e is returned on standard
                   output); a value of 11 is set if _c_a_p_n_a_m_e is not defined  for
                   this terminal _t_y_p_e (nothing is written to standard output).

            _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
                   a value of 00 is always  set,  whether  or  not  _c_a_p_n_a_m_e  is
                   defined for this terminal _t_y_p_e.  To determine if _c_a_p_n_a_m_e is
                   defined for this terminal _t_y_p_e,  the  user  must  test  the
                   value written to standard output.  A value of --11 means that
                   _c_a_p_n_a_m_e is not defined for this terminal _t_y_p_e.

            _o_t_h_e_r  rreesseett or iinniitt may fail to find their respective files.   In
                   that case, the exit code is set to 4 + eerrrrnnoo.

       Any other exit code indicates an error; see the DIAGNOSTICS section.

       Htop is a free (GPL) ncurses-based process viewer for Linux.

       It  is similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and horizon-
       tally, so you can see all the processes running on  the  system,  along
       with  their  full  command  lines, as well as viewing them as a process
       tree, selecting multiple processes and acting on them all at once.

       Tasks related to processes (killing,  renicing)  can  be  done  without
       entering their PIDs.

       UUpp,, AAlltt--kk
            Select (highlight) the  previous  process  in  the  process  list.
            Scroll the list if necessary.

       DDoowwnn,, AAlltt--jj

            Scroll the process list left.

       RRiigghhtt,, AAlltt--ll
            Scroll the process list right.

       PPggUUpp,, PPggDDnn
            Scroll the process list up or down one window.

       HHoommee Scroll to the top  of  the  process  list  and  select  the  first
            process.

       EEnndd  Scroll  to  the  bottom  of  the  process list and select the last
            process.

       CCttrrll--AA,, ^^
            Scroll left to the beginning of the process entry (i.e.  beginning
            of line).

       CCttrrll--EE,, $$
            Scroll right to the end of the process entry (i.e. end of line).

       SSppaaccee
            Tag or untag a process. Commands that can operate on multiple pro-
            cesses, like ""kill"", will then apply over the list of tagged  pro-
            cesses, instead of the currently highlighted one.

       UU    Untag all processes (remove all tags added with the Space key).

       ss    Trace  process  system  calls: if strace(1) is installed, pressing
            this key will attach it to the currently  selected  process,  pre-
            senting a live update of system calls issued by the process.

       ll    Display  open files for a process: if lsof(1) is installed, press-
            ing this key will display the list of file descriptors  opened  by
            the process.

       FF11,, hh,, ??
            Go to the help screen

       FF22,, SS
            Go  to  the  setup screen, where you can configure the meters dis-
            played at the top of the  screen,  set  various  display  options,
            choose  among  color  schemes,  and  select which columns are dis-
            played, in which order.

       FF33,, //
            Incrementally search the command lines of all the  displayed  pro-
            cesses.  The  currently selected (highlighted) command will update
            as you type. While in search mode, pressing F3 will cycle  through
            matching occurrences.

       FF44,, \\
            Incremental  process  filtering: type in part of a process command
            line and only processes whose names match will be shown. To cancel
            filtering, enter the Filter option again and press Esc.

       FF55,, tt
            Tree  view: organize processes by parenthood, and layout the rela-
            tions between them as a tree. Toggling the key will switch between
            tree and your previously selected sort view. Selecting a sort view
            will exit tree view.

       FF66   On sorted view,  select  a  field  for  sorting,  also  accessible
            through  <  and >.  The current sort field is indicated by a high-
            light in the header.  On tree view, expand or collapse the current
            subtree.  A  ""+""  indicator  in the tree node indicates that it is
            collapsed.

       FF77,, ]]
            Increase the selected process's  priority  (subtract  from  'nice'
            value).  This can only be done by the superuser.

       FF88,, [[
            Decrease the selected process's priority (add to 'nice' value)

       FF99,, kk
            ""Kill"" process: sends a signal which is selected in a menu, to one
            or a group of processes. If processes were tagged, sends the  sig-
            nal to all tagged processes.  If none is tagged, sends to the cur-
            rently selected process.

       FF1100,, qq
            Quit

       II    Invert the sort order: if sort  order  is  increasing,  switch  to
            decreasing, and vice-versa.

       ++,, -- When in tree view mode, expand or collapse subtree. When a subtree
            is collapsed a ""+"" sign shows to the left of the process name.

       aa ((oonn mmuullttiipprroocceessssoorr mmaacchhiinneess))
            Set CPU affinity: mark which CPUs a process is allowed to use.

       uu    Show only processes owned by a specified user.

       MM    Sort by memory usage (top compatibility key).

       PP    Sort by processor usage (top compatibility key).

       TT    Sort by time (top compatibility key).

       FF    ""Follow"" process: if the sort order causes the currently  selected
            process  to  move  in  the list, make the selection bar follow it.
            This is useful for monitoring a process: this way, you can keep  a
            process  always  visible  on  screen. When a movement key is used,
            ""follow"" loses effect.

       KK    Hide kernel threads: prevent the threads belonging the  kernel  to
            be displayed in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)

       HH    Hide user threads: on systems that represent them differently than
            ordinary processes (such as recent NPTL-based systems),  this  can
            hide  threads  from userspace processes in the process list. (This
            is a toggle key.)

       pp    Show full paths to running programs, where applicable. (This is  a
            toggle key.)

       CCttrrll--LL
            Refresh: redraw screen and recalculate values.

       NNuummbbeerrss
            PID search: type in process ID and the selection highlight will be
            moved to it.


CCOOLLUUMMNNSS
       The following columns can display data about each process. A  value  of
       '-' in all the rows indicates that a column is unsupported on your sys-
       tem, or currently unimplemented in htop. The names below are  the  ones
       used  in the ""Available Columns"" section of the setup screen. If a dif-
       ferent name is shown in htop's main screen, it is shown below in paren-

       By default htop reads its configuration  from  the  XDG-compliant  path
       ~/.config/htop/htoprc  --  the  configuration  file  is  overwritten by
       htop's in-program Setup configuration, so it should not be hand-edited.
       If no user configuration exists htop tries to read the system-wide con-
       figuration from ${prefix}/etc/htoprc and as a last resort,  falls  back
       to its hard coded defaults.

       You may override the location of the configuration file using the $HTO-
       PRC environment variable (so you can have multiple  configurations  for
       different machines that share the same home directory, for example).


MMEEMMOORRYY SSIIZZEESS
       Memory  sizes  in  htop are displayed as they are in tools from the GNU
       Coreutils (when ran with the --human-readable option). This means  that
       sizes are printed in powers of 1024. (e.g., 1023M = 1072693248 Bytes)

       The  decision  to  use  this  convention  was made in order to conserve
       screen space and make memory size representations consistent throughout
       htop.

       The  XAR  project  aims to provide an easily extensible archive format.
       Important design decisions include an easily extensible  XML  table  of
       contents  (TOC) for random access to archived files, storing the TOC at
       the beginning of  the  archive  to  allow  for  efficient  handling  of
       streamed  archives,  the  ability  to handle files of arbitrarily large
       sizes, the ability to choose independent encodings for individual files
       in  the archive, the ability to store checksums for individual files in
       both compressed and uncompressed form, and the ability to query the ta-
       ble of content's rich meta-data.

       --compression
              Specifies the compression type  to  use.   Valid  values:  none,
              gzip, bzip2, lzma (on some systems).  Default value: gzip

       -C <path>
              On extract, xar will chdir to the specified path before extract-
              ing the archive.

       -a     Synonym for --compression=lzma

       -j     Synonym for --compression=bzip2

       -z     Synonym for --compression=gzip

       --compression-args=<arguments>
              Specifies arguments to the compression engine  selected.   gzip,
              bzip2, and lzma all take a single integer argument between 0 and
              9 specifying the compression level to use.

       --dump-toc=<filename>
              Has xar dump the xml header into the specified file.  ""-"" can be
              specified to mean stdout.

       --dump-toc-cksum
              Dumps the ToC checksum to stdout along with the algorithm of the
              ToC.

       --dump-header
              Has xar print out the xar binary header information to stdout.

       --extract-subdoc=<name>
              Extracts the specified subdocument to a document  in  cwd  named
              <name>.xml

       --list-subdocs
              List the subdocuments in the xml header

       --toc-cksum
              Specifies  the hashing algorithm to use for xml header verifica-
              tion.  Valid values: md5 (on some systems),  sha1,  sha256,  and
              sha512.  Default value: sha1

       --file-cksum
              Specifies  the hashing algorithm to use for file content verifi-
              cation.  Valid values: md5 (on some systems), sha1, sha256,  and

       -l     On archival, stay on the local device.

       -P     On  extract, set ownership based on uid/gid.  If the uid/gid can
              be set on the extracted file, setuid/setgid bits  will  also  be
              preserved.

       -p     On  extract, set ownership based on symbolic names, if possible.
              If the uid/gid can be set on the extracted  file,  setuid/setgid
              bits will also be preserved.

       -s <filename>
              On  extract,  specifies the file to extract subdocuments to.  On
              archival, specifies an xml file to add as a subdocument.

       -v     Verbose output

       --exclude
              Specifies a POSIX regular expression of files  to  exclude  from
              adding  to  the  archive during creation or from being extracted
              during extraction.  This option can be specified multiple times.

       --rsize
              Specifies  a size (in bytes) for the internal libxar read buffer
              while performing I/O.

       --coalesce-heap
              When multiple files in the archive are identical, only store one
              copy  of  the  data in the heap.  This creates smaller archives,
              but the archives created are not streamable.

       --link-same
              When the data section of multiple files are identical,  hardlink
              them within the archive.

       --no-compress
              Specifies  a  POSIX  regular expression of files to archive, but
              not compress.  The archived files will be copied  raw  into  the
              archive.  This can be used to exclude already gzipped files from
              being gzipped during the archival process.

       --prop-include
              Specifies a file property to be included in the  archive.   When
              this  option  is  specified,  only the specified options will be
              included.  Anything not specifically included with  this  option
              will be omitted.  This option can be used multiple times.

       --prop-exclude
              Specifies a file property to be excluded from the archive.  When
              this option is specified, all file properties will  be  included
              except the specified properties.  This option can be used multi-
              ple times.

       --distribution
              Creates an archive to only contain file properties safe for file
              distribution.   Currently,  only  name, type, mode, and data are
              preserved with this option.

       --keep-existing
              Does not overwrite existing files during extraction.  Keeps  any
              previously existing files while extracting.

       -k     Synonym for --keep-existing.

       --keep-setuid
              When extracting without -p or -P options, xar will extract files
              as the uid/gid of the extracting process.   In  this  situation,
              xar  will  strip setuid/setgid bits from the extracted files for
              security reasons.  --keep-setuid will preserve the setuid/setgid
              bits  even  though  the uid/gid of the extracted file is not the
              same as the archived file.

     The hhaalltt and rreebboooott utilities flush the file system cache to disk, send
     all running processes a SIGTERM (and subsequently a SIGKILL) and, respec-
     tively, halt or restart the system.  The action is logged, including
     entering a shutdown record into the wtmp(5) file.

     When the system is halted with the halt command, the system is powered
     off.

     The options are as follows:

     --ll      The halt or reboot is _n_o_t recorded in the system log.  This
             option is intended for applications such as shutdown(8), that
             call rreebboooott or hhaalltt and log this themselves.

     --nn      The file system cache is not flushed.  This option should proba-
             bly not be used.

     --qq      The system is halted or restarted quickly and ungracefully, and
             only the flushing of the file system cache is performed (if the
             --nn option is not specified).  This option should probably not be
             used.

     --uu      The system is halted up until the point of removing system power,
             but waits before removing power for 5 minutes so that an external
             UPS (uninterruptible power supply) can forcibly remove power.
             This simulates a dirty shutdown to permit a later automatic power
             on. OS X uses this mode automatically with supported UPSs in
             emergency shutdowns.

     Normally, the shutdown(8) utility is used when the system needs to be
     halted or restarted, giving users advance warning of their impending doom
     and cleanly terminating specific programs.

     The SIGKILL will follow the SIGTERM by an intentionally indeterminate
     period of time.  Programs are expected to take only enough time to flush
     all dirty data and exit.  Developers are encouraged to file a bug with
     the OS vendor, should they encounter an issue with this functionality.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The llooccaattee program searches a database for all pathnames which match the
     specified _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  The database is recomputed periodically (usually
     weekly or daily), and contains the pathnames of all files which are pub-
     licly accessible.

     Shell globbing and quoting characters (``*'', ``?'', ``\'', ``['' and
     ``]'') may be used in _p_a_t_t_e_r_n, although they will have to be escaped from
     the shell.  Preceding any character with a backslash (``\'') eliminates
     any special meaning which it may have.  The matching differs in that no
     characters must be matched explicitly, including slashes (``/'').

     As a special case, a pattern containing no globbing characters (``foo'')
     is matched as though it were ``*foo*''.

     Historically, locate only stored characters between 32 and 127.  The cur-
     rent implementation store any character except newline (`\n') and NUL
     (`\0').  The 8-bit character support does not waste extra space for plain
     ASCII file names.  Characters less than 32 or greater than 127 are stored
     in 2 bytes.

     The following options are available:

     --00          Print pathnames separated by an ASCII NUL character (charac-
                 ter code 0) instead of default NL (newline, character code
                 10).

     --SS          Print some statistics about the database and exit.

     --cc          Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching
                 file names.

     --dd _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e
                 Search in _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e instead of the default file name database.
                 Multiple --dd options are allowed.  Each additional --dd option
                 adds the specified database to the list of databases to be
                 searched.

                 The option _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e may be a colon-separated list of data-
                 bases.  A single colon is a reference to the default data-
                 base.

                 $ locate -d $HOME/lib/mydb: foo

                 will first search string ``foo'' in _$_H_O_M_E_/_l_i_b_/_m_y_d_b and then
                 in _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_l_o_c_a_t_e_._d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e.

                 $ locate -d $HOME/lib/mydb::/cdrom/locate.database foo

                 will first search string ``foo'' in _$_H_O_M_E_/_l_i_b_/_m_y_d_b and then

                       $ locate -d db1 -d db2 -d db3 pattern

                 or

                       $ locate -d db1:db2 -d db3 pattern

                 If -- is given as the database name, standard input will be
                 read instead.  For example, you can compress your database
                 and use:

                 $ zcat database.gz | locate -d - pattern

                 This might be useful on machines with a fast CPU and little
                 RAM and slow I/O.  Note: you can only use _o_n_e pattern for
                 stdin.

     The llooccaattee command first appeared in 4.4BSD.  Many new features were
     added in FreeBSD 2.2.

BBUUGGSS
     The llooccaattee program may fail to list some files that are present, or may
     list files that have been removed from the system.  This is because
     locate only reports files that are present in the database, which is typ-
     ically only regenerated once a week by the
     _/_S_y_s_t_e_m_/_L_i_b_r_a_r_y_/_L_a_u_n_c_h_D_a_e_m_o_n_s_/_c_o_m_._a_p_p_l_e_._l_o_c_a_t_e_._p_l_i_s_t job.  Use find(1) to
     locate files that are of a more transitory nature.

     The llooccaattee database is typically built by user ``nobody'' and the
     locate.updatedb(8) utility skips directories which are not readable for
     user ``nobody'', group ``nobody'', or world.  For example, if your HOME
     directory is not world-readable, _n_o_n_e of your files are in the database.

     The llooccaattee database is not byte order independent.  It is not possible to
     share the databases between machines with different byte order.  The cur-
     rent llooccaattee implementation understands databases in host byte order or
     network byte order if both architectures use the same integer size.  So
     on a FreeBSD/i386 machine (little endian), you can read a locate database
     which was built on SunOS/sparc machine (big endian, net).

     The llooccaattee utility does not recognize multibyte characters.

     QQuuoottaacchheecckk examines each filesystem, builds a table of current disk
     usage, and compares this table against that recorded in the disk quota
     file for the filesystem.  If any inconsistencies are detected, both the
     quota file and the current system copy of the incorrect quotas are
     updated (the latter only occurs if an active filesystem is checked).  By
     default both user and group quotas are checked.

     Available options:

     --aa      If the --aa flag is supplied in place of any filesystem names,
             qquuoottaacchheecckk will check all the read-write filesystems with an
             existing mount option file at its root.  The mount option file
             specifies the types of quotas that are to be checked.

     --gg      Only group quotas are checked. The mount option file,
             _._q_u_o_t_a_._o_p_s_._g_r_o_u_p, must exist at the root of the filesystem.

     --uu      Only user quotas are checked.  The mount option file,
             _._q_u_o_t_a_._o_p_s_._u_s_e_r, must exist at the root of the filesystem.

     --vv      qquuoottaacchheecckk reports discrepancies between the calculated and
             recorded disk quotas.

     Specifying both --gg and --uu is equivalent to the default.  Parallel passes
     are run on the filesystems required, in an identical fashion to fsck(8).

     Normally qquuoottaacchheecckk operates silently.

     QQuuoottaacchheecckk expects each filesystem being checked to have quota data files
     named _._q_u_o_t_a_._u_s_e_r and/or _._q_u_o_t_a_._g_r_o_u_p located at the filesystem root.  If
     a binary data file is not present, qquuoottaacchheecckk will create it.  The
     default filename and root location cannot be overridden.

     QQuuoottaacchheecckk is normally run at _f_s_c_k time.

     QQuuoottaacchheecckk accesses the raw device in calculating the actual disk usage
     for each user.  Thus, the filesystems checked should be quiescent while
     qquuoottaacchheecckk is running.

FFIILLEESS
     Each of the following quota files is located at the root of the mounted
     filesystem.  The mount option files are empty files whose existence indi-
     cates that quotas are to be enabled for that filesystem. The binary data
     files will be created by quotacheck, if they don't already exist.
