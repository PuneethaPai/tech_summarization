     ffiinndd -- walk a file hierarchy

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
     ffiinndd [--HH | --LL | --PP] [--EEXXddssxx] [--ff _p_a_t_h] _p_a_t_h _._._. [_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ffiinndd utility recursively descends the directory tree for each _p_a_t_h
     listed, evaluating an _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n (composed of the ``primaries'' and
     ``operands'' listed below) in terms of each file in the tree.

     The options are as follows:

     --EE      Interpret regular expressions followed by --rreeggeexx and --iirreeggeexx pri-
             maries as extended (modern) regular expressions rather than basic
             regular expressions (BRE's).  The re_format(7) manual page fully
             describes both formats.

     --HH      Cause the file information and file type (see stat(2)) returned
             for each symbolic link specified on the command line to be those
             of the file referenced by the link, not the link itself.  If the
             referenced file does not exist, the file information and type
             will be for the link itself.  File information of all symbolic
             links not on the command line is that of the link itself.

     --LL      Cause the file information and file type (see stat(2)) returned
             for each symbolic link to be those of the file referenced by the
             link, not the link itself.  If the referenced file does not
             exist, the file information and type will be for the link itself.

             This option is equivalent to the deprecated --ffoollllooww primary.

     --PP      Cause the file information and file type (see stat(2)) returned
             for each symbolic link to be those of the link itself.  This is
             the default.

     --XX      Permit ffiinndd to be safely used in conjunction with xargs(1).  If a
             file name contains any of the delimiting characters used by
             xargs(1), a diagnostic message is displayed on standard error,
             and the file is skipped.  The delimiting characters include sin-
             gle (`` ' '') and double (`` "" '') quotes, backslash (``\''),
             space, tab and newline characters.

             However, you may wish to consider the --pprriinntt00 primary in conjunc-
             tion with ``xxaarrggss --00'' as an effective alternative.

     --dd      Cause ffiinndd to perform a depth-first traversal, i.e., directories
             are visited in post-order and all entries in a directory will be
             acted on before the directory itself.  By default, ffiinndd visits
             directories in pre-order, i.e., before their contents.  Note, the
             default is _n_o_t a breadth-first traversal.

             This option is equivalent to the --ddeepptthh primary of IEEE Std
             1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'').  The --dd option can be useful when ffiinndd
             is used with cpio(1) to process files that are contained in
             directories with unusual permissions.  It ensures that you have
             write permission while you are placing files in a directory, then
             sets the directory's permissions as the last thing.

     --ff      Specify a file hierarchy for ffiinndd to traverse.  File hierarchies
             may also be specified as the operands immediately following the
             options.

     --ss      Cause ffiinndd to traverse the file hierarchies in lexicographical
             order, i.e., alphabetical order within each directory.  Note:
             `find -s' and `find | sort' may give different results.

     --xx      Prevent ffiinndd from descending into directories that have a device
             number different than that of the file from which the descent
             began.

             This option is equivalent to the deprecated --xxddeevv primary.

PPRRIIMMAARRIIEESS
     All primaries which take a numeric argument allow the number to be pre-
     ceded by a plus sign (``+'') or a minus sign (``-'').  A preceding plus
     sign means ``more than n'', a preceding minus sign means ``less than n''
     and neither means ``exactly n''.

     --BBmmiinn _n
             True if the difference between the time of a file's inode cre-
             ation and the time ffiinndd was started, rounded up to the next full
             minute, is _n minutes.

     --BBttiimmee _n[ssmmhhddww]
             If no units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the time of a file's inode creation and the
             time ffiinndd was started, rounded up to the next full 24-hour
             period, is _n 24-hour periods.

             If units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the time of a file's inode creation and the
             time ffiinndd was started is exactly _n units.  Please refer to the
             --aattiimmee primary description for information on supported time
             units.

     --aaccll    May be used in conjunction with other primaries to locate files
             with extended ACLs.  See acl(3) for more information.

     --aammiinn _n
             True if the difference between the file last access time and the

             was started, rounded up to the next full 24-hour period, is _n
             24-hour periods.

             If units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the file last access time and the time ffiinndd
             was started is exactly _n units.  Possible time units are as fol-
             lows:

             ss       second
             mm       minute (60 seconds)
             hh       hour (60 minutes)
             dd       day (24 hours)
             ww       week (7 days)

             Any number of units may be combined in one --aattiimmee argument, for
             example, ``-atime -1h30m''.  Units are probably only useful when
             used in conjunction with the ++ or -- modifier.

     --ccmmiinn _n
             True if the difference between the time of last change of file
             status information and the time ffiinndd was started, rounded up to
             the next full minute, is _n minutes.

             Same as --nneewweerrccmm.

     --ccttiimmee _n[ssmmhhddww]
             If no units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the time of last change of file status infor-
             mation and the time ffiinndd was started, rounded up to the next full
             24-hour period, is _n 24-hour periods.

             If units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the time of last change of file status infor-
             mation and the time ffiinndd was started is exactly _n units.  Please
             refer to the --aattiimmee primary description for information on sup-
             ported time units.

     --dd      Same as ddeepptthh.  GNU find implements this as a primary in mistaken
             emulation of FreeBSD find(1).

     --ddeelleettee
             Delete found files and/or directories.  Always returns true.
             This executes from the current working directory as ffiinndd recurses
             down the tree.  It will not attempt to delete a filename with a
             ``_/'' character in its pathname relative to ``_.'' for security
             reasons.  Depth-first traversal processing is implied by this
             option.  Following symlinks is incompatible with this option.

     --ddeepptthh  Always true; same as the --dd option.

     --ddeepptthh _n
             True if the depth of the file relative to the starting point of
             the traversal is _n.

     --eemmppttyy  True if the current file or directory is empty.

     --eexxeecc _u_t_i_l_i_t_y [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _._._.] ;
             True if the program named _u_t_i_l_i_t_y returns a zero value as its
             exit status.  Optional _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s may be passed to the utility.
             The expression must be terminated by a semicolon (``;'').  If you
             invoke ffiinndd from a shell you may need to quote the semicolon if
             the shell would otherwise treat it as a control operator.  If the
             string ``{}'' appears anywhere in the utility name or the argu-
             ments it is replaced by the pathname of the current file.
             _U_t_i_l_i_t_y will be executed from the directory from which ffiinndd was
             executed.  _U_t_i_l_i_t_y and _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s are not subject to the further
             expansion of shell patterns and constructs.

     --eexxeecc _u_t_i_l_i_t_y [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _._._.] {} +
             Same as --eexxeecc, except that ``{}'' is replaced with as many path-
             names as possible for each invocation of _u_t_i_l_i_t_y.  This behaviour
             is similar to that of xargs(1).

     --eexxeeccddiirr _u_t_i_l_i_t_y [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _._._.] ;
             The --eexxeeccddiirr primary is identical to the --eexxeecc primary with the
             exception that _u_t_i_l_i_t_y will be executed from the directory that
             holds the current file.  The filename substituted for the string
             ``{}'' is not qualified.

     --eexxeeccddiirr _u_t_i_l_i_t_y [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _._._.] {} +
             Same as --eexxeeccddiirr, except that ``{}'' is replaced with as many
             pathnames as possible for each invocation of _u_t_i_l_i_t_y.  This be-
             haviour is similar to that of xargs(1).

     --ffllaaggss [--|++]_f_l_a_g_s,_n_o_t_f_l_a_g_s
             The flags are specified using symbolic names (see chflags(1)).
             Those with the ""no"" prefix (except ""nodump"") are said to be
             _n_o_t_f_l_a_g_s.  Flags in _f_l_a_g_s are checked to be set, and flags in
             _n_o_t_f_l_a_g_s are checked to be not set.  Note that this is different
             from --ppeerrmm, which only allows the user to specify mode bits that
             are set.

             If flags are preceded by a dash (``-''), this primary evaluates
             to true if at least all of the bits in _f_l_a_g_s and none of the bits
             in _n_o_t_f_l_a_g_s are set in the file's flags bits.  If flags are pre-
             ceded by a plus (``+''), this primary evaluates to true if any of
             the bits in _f_l_a_g_s is set in the file's flags bits, or any of the
             bits in _n_o_t_f_l_a_g_s is not set in the file's flags bits.  Otherwise,
             this primary evaluates to true if the bits in _f_l_a_g_s exactly match
             the file's flags bits, and none of the _f_l_a_g_s bits match those of
             _n_o_t_f_l_a_g_s.

             True if the file is contained in a file system of type _t_y_p_e.  The
             lsvfs(1) command can be used to find out the types of file sys-
             tems that are available on the system.  In addition, there are
             two pseudo-types, ``local'' and ``rdonly''.  The former matches
             any file system physically mounted on the system where the ffiinndd
             is being executed and the latter matches any file system which is
             mounted read-only.

     --ggiidd _g_n_a_m_e
             The same thing as _-_g_r_o_u_p _g_n_a_m_e for compatibility with GNU find.
             GNU find imposes a restriction that _g_n_a_m_e is numeric, while
             find(1) does not.

     --ggrroouupp _g_n_a_m_e
             True if the file belongs to the group _g_n_a_m_e.  If _g_n_a_m_e is numeric
             and there is no such group name, then _g_n_a_m_e is treated as a group
             ID.

     --iiggnnoorree__rreeaaddddiirr__rraaccee
             This option is for GNU find compatibility and is ignored.

     --iillnnaammee _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             Like --llnnaammee, but the match is case insensitive.  This is a GNU
             find extension.

     --iinnaammee _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             Like --nnaammee, but the match is case insensitive.

     --iinnuumm _n
             True if the file has inode number _n.

     --iippaatthh _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             Like --ppaatthh, but the match is case insensitive.

     --iirreeggeexx _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             Like --rreeggeexx, but the match is case insensitive.

     --iiwwhhoolleennaammee _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             The same thing as --iippaatthh, for GNU find compatibility.

     --lliinnkkss _n
             True if the file has _n links.

     --llnnaammee _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             Like --nnaammee, but the contents of the symbolic link are matched
             instead of the file name.  Note that this only matches broken
             symbolic links if symbolic links are being followed.  This is a
             GNU find extension.

     --llss     This primary always evaluates to true.  The following information
             for the current file is written to standard output: its inode
             number, size in 512-byte blocks, file permissions, number of hard
             links, owner, group, size in bytes, last modification time, and
             pathname.  If the file is a block or character special file, the
             device number will be displayed instead of the size in bytes.  If
             the file is a symbolic link, the pathname of the linked-to file
             will be displayed preceded by ``->''.  The format is identical to
             that produced by ``llss --ddggiillss''.

     --mmaaxxddeepptthh _n
             Always true; descend at most _n directory levels below the command
             line arguments.  If any --mmaaxxddeepptthh primary is specified, it
             applies to the entire expression even if it would not normally be
             evaluated.  ``--mmaaxxddeepptthh 0'' limits the whole search to the com-
             mand line arguments.

     --mmiinnddeepptthh _n
             Always true; do not apply any tests or actions at levels less
             than _n.  If any --mmiinnddeepptthh primary is specified, it applies to the
             entire expression even if it would not normally be evaluated.
             ``--mmiinnddeepptthh 1'' processes all but the command line arguments.

     --mmmmiinn _n
             True if the difference between the file last modification time
             and the time ffiinndd was started, rounded up to the next full
             minute, is _n minutes.

     --mmnneewweerr _f_i_l_e
             Same as --nneewweerr.

     --mmoouunntt  The same thing as --xxddeevv, for GNU find compatibility.

     --mmttiimmee _n[ssmmhhddww]
             If no units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the file last modification time and the time
             ffiinndd was started, rounded up to the next full 24-hour period, is
             _n 24-hour periods.

             If units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the file last modification time and the time
             ffiinndd was started is exactly _n units.  Please refer to the --aattiimmee
             primary description for information on supported time units.

     --nnaammee _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             True if the last component of the pathname being examined matches
             _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  Special shell pattern matching characters (``['',
             ``]'', ``*'', and ``?'') may be used as part of _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  These
             characters may be matched explicitly by escaping them with a
             backslash (``\'').

     --nneewweerr _f_i_l_e
             True if the current file has a more recent last modification time
             than _f_i_l_e.

     --nneewweerr_X_Y _f_i_l_e
             True if the current file has a more recent last access time
             (_X=aa), inode creation time (_X=BB), change time (_X=cc), or modifica-
             tion time (_X=mm) than the last access time (_Y=aa), inode creation
             time (_Y=BB), change time (_Y=cc), or modification time (_Y=mm) of
             _f_i_l_e.  In addition, if _Y=tt, then _f_i_l_e is instead interpreted as a
             direct date specification of the form understood by cvs(1).  Note
             that --nneewweerrmmmm is equivalent to --nneewweerr.

     --nnooggrroouupp
             True if the file belongs to an unknown group.

     --nnooiiggnnoorree__rreeaaddddiirr__rraaccee
             This option is for GNU find compatibility and is ignored.

     --nnoolleeaaff
             This option is for GNU find compatibility.  In GNU find it dis-
             ables an optimization not relevant to find(1), so it is ignored.

     --nnoouusseerr
             True if the file belongs to an unknown user.

     --ookk _u_t_i_l_i_t_y [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _._._.] ;
             The --ookk primary is identical to the --eexxeecc primary with the excep-
             tion that ffiinndd requests user affirmation for the execution of the
             _u_t_i_l_i_t_y by printing a message to the terminal and reading a
             response.  If the response is not affirmative (`y' in the
             ``POSIX'' locale), the command is not executed and the value of
             the --ookk expression is false.

     --ookkddiirr _u_t_i_l_i_t_y [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _._._.] ;
             The --ookkddiirr primary is identical to the --eexxeeccddiirr primary with the
             same exception as described for the --ookk primary.

     --ppaatthh _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             True if the pathname being examined matches _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  Special
             shell pattern matching characters (``['', ``]'', ``*'', and
             ``?'') may be used as part of _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  These characters may be
             matched explicitly by escaping them with a backslash (``\'').
             Slashes (``/'') are treated as normal characters and do not have
             to be matched explicitly.

     --ppeerrmm [--|++]_m_o_d_e
             The _m_o_d_e may be either symbolic (see chmod(1)) or an octal num-
             ber.  If the _m_o_d_e is symbolic, a starting value of zero is
             assumed and the _m_o_d_e sets or clears permissions without regard to
             the process' file mode creation mask.  If the _m_o_d_e is octal, only
             bits 07777 (S_ISUID | S_ISGID | S_ISTXT | S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG |
             S_IRWXO) of the file's mode bits participate in the comparison.
             If the _m_o_d_e is preceded by a dash (``-''), this primary evaluates
             to true if at least all of the bits in the _m_o_d_e are set in the
             file's mode bits.  If the _m_o_d_e is preceded by a plus (``+''),
             this primary evaluates to true if any of the bits in the _m_o_d_e are
             set in the file's mode bits.  Otherwise, this primary evaluates
             to true if the bits in the _m_o_d_e exactly match the file's mode
             bits.  Note, the first character of a symbolic mode may not be a
             dash (``-'').

     --pprriinntt  This primary always evaluates to true.  It prints the pathname of
             the current file to standard output.  If none of --eexxeecc, --llss,
             --pprriinntt, --pprriinntt00, or --ookk is specified, the given expression shall
             be effectively replaced by (( _g_i_v_e_n _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n )) --pprriinntt.

     --pprriinntt00
             This primary always evaluates to true.  It prints the pathname of
             the current file to standard output, followed by an ASCII NUL
             character (character code 0).

     --pprruunnee  This primary always evaluates to true.  It causes ffiinndd to not
             descend into the current file.  Note, the --pprruunnee primary has no
             effect if the --dd option was specified.

     --rreeggeexx _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             True if the whole path of the file matches _p_a_t_t_e_r_n using regular
             expression.  To match a file named ``_._/_f_o_o_/_x_y_z_z_y'', you can use
             the regular expression ``.*/[xyz]*'' or ``.*/foo/.*'', but not
             ``xyzzy'' or ``/foo/''.

     --ssaammeeffiillee _n_a_m_e
             True if the file is a hard link to _n_a_m_e.  If the command option
             --LL is specified, it is also true if the file is a symbolic link
             and points to _n_a_m_e.

     --ssiizzee _n[cckkMMGGTTPP]
             True if the file's size, rounded up, in 512-byte blocks is _n.  If
             _n is followed by a cc, then the primary is true if the file's size
             is _n bytes (characters).  Similarly if _n is followed by a scale
             indicator then the file's size is compared to _n scaled as:

             kk       kilobytes (1024 bytes)
             MM       megabytes (1024 kilobytes)
             GG       gigabytes (1024 megabytes)
             TT       terabytes (1024 gigabytes)
             PP       petabytes (1024 terabytes)

     --ttyyppee _t
             True if the file is of the specified type.  Possible file types
             are as follows:

             bb       block special
             cc       character special
             dd       directory
             ff       regular file
             ll       symbolic link
             pp       FIFO
             ss       socket

     --uuiidd _u_n_a_m_e
             The same thing as _-_u_s_e_r _u_n_a_m_e for compatibility with GNU find.
             GNU find imposes a restriction that _u_n_a_m_e is numeric, while
             find(1) does not.

     --uusseerr _u_n_a_m_e
             True if the file belongs to the user _u_n_a_m_e.  If _u_n_a_m_e is numeric
             and there is no such user name, then _u_n_a_m_e is treated as a user
             ID.

     --wwhhoolleennaammee _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
             The same thing as --ppaatthh, for GNU find compatibility.

     --xxaattttrr  True if the file has any extended attributes.

     --xxaattttrrnnaammee _n_a_m_e
             True if the file has an extended attribute with the specified
             _n_a_m_e.

OOPPEERRAATTOORRSS
     The primaries may be combined using the following operators.  The opera-
     tors are listed in order of decreasing precedence.

     (( _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n ))
             This evaluates to true if the parenthesized expression evaluates
             to true.

     !! _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
     --nnoott _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
             This is the unary NOT operator.  It evaluates to true if the
             expression is false.

     --ffaallssee  Always false.
     --ttrruuee   Always true.

     _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n --aanndd _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
     _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
             The --aanndd operator is the logical AND operator.  As it is implied
             by the juxtaposition of two expressions it does not have to be
             specified.  The expression evaluates to true if both expressions
             are true.  The second expression is not evaluated if the first
             expression is false.

     _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n --oorr _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
             The --oorr operator is the logical OR operator.  The expression
             evaluates to true if either the first or the second expression is
             true.  The second expression is not evaluated if the first
             expression is true.

     All operands and primaries must be separate arguments to ffiinndd.  Primaries
     which themselves take arguments expect each argument to be a separate
     argument to ffiinndd.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     The LANG, LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES and LC_TIME environ-
     ment variables affect the execution of the ffiinndd utility as described in
     environ(7).

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     The following examples are shown as given to the shell:

     find / \! -name ""*.c"" -print
             Print out a list of all the files whose names do not end in _._c.

     find / -newer ttt -user wnj -print
             Print out a list of all the files owned by user ``wnj'' that are
             newer than the file _t_t_t.

     find / \! \( -newer ttt -user wnj \) -print
             Print out a list of all the files which are not both newer than
             _t_t_t and owned by ``wnj''.

     find / \( -newer ttt -or -user wnj \) -print
             Print out a list of all the files that are either owned by
             ``wnj'' or that are newer than _t_t_t.

     find / -newerct '1 minute ago' -print
             Print out a list of all the files whose inode change time is more
             recent than the current time minus one minute.

     find / -type f -exec echo {} \;
             Use the echo(1) command to print out a list of all the files.

     find -L /usr/ports/packages -type l -exec rm -- {} +
             Delete all broken symbolic links in _/_u_s_r_/_p_o_r_t_s_/_p_a_c_k_a_g_e_s.

     find /usr/src -name CVS -prune -o -depth +6 -print
             Find files and directories that are at least seven levels deep in
             the working directory _/_u_s_r_/_s_r_c.

     find /usr/src -name CVS -prune -o -mindepth 7 -print
             Is not equivalent to the previous example, since --pprruunnee is not
             evaluated below level seven.

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
     The --ffoollllooww primary is deprecated; the --LL option should be used instead.

SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS
     The ffiinndd utility syntax is a superset of the syntax specified by the IEEE
     Std 1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'') standard.

     All the single character options except --HH and --LL as well as --aammiinn,
     --aanneewweerr, --ccmmiinn, --ccnneewweerr, --ddeelleettee, --eemmppttyy, --ffssttyyppee, --iinnaammee, --iinnuumm,
     --iirreeggeexx, --llss, --mmaaxxddeepptthh, --mmiinnddeepptthh, --mmmmiinn, --ppaatthh, --pprriinntt00, --rreeggeexx and all
     of the --BB** birthtime related primaries are extensions to IEEE Std
     1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'').

     Historically, the --dd, --LL and --xx options were implemented using the pri-
     maries --ddeepptthh, --ffoollllooww, and --xxddeevv.  These primaries always evaluated to
     true.  As they were really global variables that took effect before the
     traversal began, some legal expressions could have unexpected results.
     An example is the expression --pprriinntt --oo --ddeepptthh.  As --pprriinntt always evalu-
     ates to true, the standard order of evaluation implies that --ddeepptthh would
     never be evaluated.  This is not the case.

     The operator --oorr was implemented as --oo, and the operator --aanndd was imple-
     mented as --aa.

     Historic implementations of the --eexxeecc and --ookk primaries did not replace
     the string ``{}'' in the utility name or the utility arguments if it had
     preceding or following non-whitespace characters.  This version replaces
     it no matter where in the utility name or arguments it appears.

     The --EE option was inspired by the equivalent grep(1) and sed(1) options.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     A ffiinndd command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.

BBUUGGSS
     The special characters used by ffiinndd are also special characters to many
     shell programs.  In particular, the characters ``*'', ``['', ``]'',
     ``?'', ``('', ``)'', ``!'', ``\'' and ``;'' may have to be escaped from
     the shell.

     As there is no delimiter separating options and file names or file names
     and the _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n, it is difficult to specify files named _-_x_d_e_v or _!.
     These problems are handled by the --ff option and the getopt(3) ``----'' con-
     struct.

     The --ddeelleettee primary does not interact well with other options that cause
     the file system tree traversal options to be changed.

     The --mmiinnddeepptthh and --mmaaxxddeepptthh primaries are actually global options (as
     documented above).  They should probably be replaced by options which
     look like options.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _L_e_s_s is a program similar to _m_o_r_e (1), but which allows backward  move-
       ment in the file as well as forward movement.  Also, _l_e_s_s does not have
       to read the entire input file before  starting,  so  with  large  input
       files  it  starts  up  faster than text editors like _v_i (1).  _L_e_s_s uses
       termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on  a  variety  of
       terminals.   There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.  (On
       a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at the  top  of  the
       screen are prefixed with a caret.)

       Commands  are based on both _m_o_r_e and _v_i_.  Commands may be preceded by a
       decimal number, called N in the descriptions below.  The number is used
       by some commands, as indicated.


CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
       In  the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.  ESC stands for the
       ESCAPE  key;  for  example  ESC-v  means  the  two  character  sequence
       ""ESCAPE"", then ""v"".

       h or H Help:  display  a  summary of these commands.  If you forget all
              the other commands, remember this one.

       SPACE or ^V or f or ^F
              Scroll forward N  lines,  default  one  window  (see  option  -z
              below).   If  N  is  more  than  the screen size, only the final
              screenful is displayed.  Warning: some systems use ^V as a  spe-
              cial literalization character.

       z      Like  SPACE,  but  if  N is specified, it becomes the new window
              size.

       ESC-SPACE
              Like SPACE, but scrolls a full screenful,  even  if  it  reaches
              end-of-file in the process.

       ENTER or RETURN or ^N or e or ^E or j or ^J
              Scroll  forward N lines, default 1.  The entire N lines are dis-
              played, even if N is more than the screen size.

       d or ^D
              Scroll forward N lines, default one half of the screen size.  If
              N  is specified, it becomes the new default for subsequent d and
              u commands.

       b or ^B or ESC-v
              Scroll backward N lines,  default  one  window  (see  option  -z
              below).   If  N  is  more  than  the screen size, only the final
              screenful is displayed.

       w      Like ESC-v, but if N is specified, it  becomes  the  new  window
              size.

       y or ^Y or ^P or k or ^K
              Scroll backward N lines, default 1.  The entire N lines are dis-
              played, even if N is more than the screen size.   Warning:  some
              systems use ^Y as a special job control character.

       u or ^U
              Scroll  backward  N  lines, default one half of the screen size.
              If N is specified, it becomes the new default for  subsequent  d
              and u commands.

       J      Like j, but continues to scroll beyond the end of the file.

       K or Y Like  k,  but  continues  to  scroll beyond the beginning of the
              file.

       ESC-) or RIGHTARROW
              Scroll horizontally right N characters, default half the  screen
              width  (see  the  -#  option).   If  a number N is specified, it
              becomes the default for future  RIGHTARROW  and  LEFTARROW  com-
              mands.   While  the  text  is scrolled, it acts as though the -S
              option (chop lines) were in effect.

       ESC-( or LEFTARROW
              Scroll horizontally left N characters, default half  the  screen
              width  (see  the  -#  option).   If  a number N is specified, it
              becomes the default for future  RIGHTARROW  and  LEFTARROW  com-
              mands.

       ESC-} or ^RIGHTARROW
              Scroll  horizontally  right  to show the end of the longest dis-
              played line.

       ESC-{ or ^LEFTARROW
              Scroll horizontally left back to the first column.

       r or ^R or ^L
              Repaint the screen.

       R      Repaint the screen, discarding any buffered  input.   Useful  if
              the file is changing while it is being viewed.

       F      Scroll  forward, and keep trying to read when the end of file is
              reached.  Normally this command would be used  when  already  at
              the  end of the file.  It is a way to monitor the tail of a file
              which is growing while it is being  viewed.   (The  behavior  is
              similar to the ""tail -f"" command.)

       ESC-F  Like  F,  but  as soon as a line is found which matches the last
              search pattern, the terminal bell is rung and forward  scrolling
              stops.

       g or < or ESC-<
              Go to line N in the file, default 1 (beginning of file).  (Warn-
              ing: this may be slow if N is large.)

       G or > or ESC->
              Go to line N in the file, default the end of the  file.   (Warn-
              ing:  this  may  be slow if N is large, or if N is not specified
              and standard input, rather than a file, is being read.)

       ESC-G  Same as G, except if no number N is specified and the  input  is
              standard  input,  goes  to  the  last  line  which  is currently
              buffered.

       p or % Go to a position N percent into the file.  N should be between 0
              and 100, and may contain a decimal point.

       P      Go to the line containing byte offset N in the file.

       {      If a left curly bracket appears in the top line displayed on the
              screen, the { command  will  go  to  the  matching  right  curly
              bracket.   The matching right curly bracket is positioned on the
              bottom line of the screen.  If there is more than one left curly
              bracket  on  the top line, a number N may be used to specify the
              N-th bracket on the line.

       }      If a right curly bracket appears in the bottom line displayed on
              the  screen,  the  }  command will go to the matching left curly
              bracket.  The matching left curly bracket is positioned  on  the
              top  line  of the screen.  If there is more than one right curly
              bracket on the top line, a number N may be used to  specify  the
              N-th bracket on the line.

       (      Like {, but applies to parentheses rather than curly brackets.

       )      Like }, but applies to parentheses rather than curly brackets.

       [      Like  {, but applies to square brackets rather than curly brack-
              ets.

       ]      Like }, but applies to square brackets rather than curly  brack-
              ets.

       ESC-^F Followed  by two characters, acts like {, but uses the two char-
              acters as open and close brackets, respectively.   For  example,
              ""ESC  ^F < >"" could be used to go forward to the > which matches
              the < in the top displayed line.

       ESC-^B Followed by two characters, acts like }, but uses the two  char-
              acters  as  open and close brackets, respectively.  For example,
              ""ESC ^B < >"" could be used to go backward to the < which matches
              the > in the bottom displayed line.

       m      Followed  by  any  lowercase  letter, marks the current position
              with that letter.

       '      (Single quote.)  Followed by any lowercase  letter,  returns  to
              the position which was previously marked with that letter.  Fol-
              lowed by another single quote, returns to the position at  which
              the last ""large"" movement command was executed.  Followed by a ^
              or $, jumps to the beginning or end of  the  file  respectively.
              Marks  are  preserved when a new file is examined, so the ' com-
              mand can be used to switch between input files.

       ^X^X   Same as single quote.

       /pattern
              Search forward in the file for the N-th line containing the pat-
              tern.  N defaults to 1.  The pattern is a regular expression, as
              recognized by the regular expression library  supplied  by  your
              system.   The search starts at the first line displayed (but see
              the -a and -j options, which change this).

              Certain characters are special if entered at  the  beginning  of
              the  pattern;  they modify the type of search rather than become
              part of the pattern:

              ^N or !
                     Search for lines which do NOT match the pattern.

              ^E or *
                     Search multiple files.  That is, if  the  search  reaches
                     the  END of the current file without finding a match, the
                     search continues in the next file  in  the  command  line
                     list.

              ^F or @
                     Begin  the  search at the first line of the FIRST file in
                     the command line list, regardless of  what  is  currently
                     displayed  on  the screen or the settings of the -a or -j
                     options.

              ^K     Highlight any text which matches the pattern on the  cur-
                     rent screen, but don't move to the first match (KEEP cur-
                     rent position).

              ^R     Don't interpret regular expression  metacharacters;  that
                     is, do a simple textual comparison.

       ?pattern
              Search  backward  in  the  file for the N-th line containing the
              pattern.  The search starts at the last line displayed (but  see
              the -a and -j options, which change this).

              Certain characters are special as in the / command:

              ^N or !
                     Search for lines which do NOT match the pattern.

              ^E or *
                     Search  multiple  files.   That is, if the search reaches
                     the beginning of  the  current  file  without  finding  a
                     match,  the  search continues in the previous file in the
                     command line list.

              ^F or @
                     Begin the search at the last line of the last file in the
                     command  line  list, regardless of what is currently dis-
                     played on the screen or the settings  of  the  -a  or  -j
                     options.

              ^K     As in forward searches.

              ^R     As in forward searches.

       ESC-/pattern
              Same as ""/*"".

       ESC-?pattern
              Same as ""?*"".

       n      Repeat  previous  search, for N-th line containing the last pat-
              tern.  If the previous search was modified by ^N, the search  is
              made  for the N-th line NOT containing the pattern.  If the pre-
              vious search was modified by ^E, the  search  continues  in  the
              next  (or  previous)  file if not satisfied in the current file.
              If the previous search was modified by ^R, the  search  is  done
              without  using  regular  expressions.  There is no effect if the
              previous search was modified by ^F or ^K.

       N      Repeat previous search, but in the reverse direction.

       ESC-n  Repeat previous  search,  but  crossing  file  boundaries.   The
              effect is as if the previous search were modified by *.

       ESC-N  Repeat  previous search, but in the reverse direction and cross-
              ing file boundaries.

       ESC-u  Undo search highlighting.   Turn  off  highlighting  of  strings
              matching the current search pattern.  If highlighting is already
              off because of a previous ESC-u command, turn highlighting  back
              on.   Any  search  command  will also turn highlighting back on.
              (Highlighting can also be disabled by toggling the -G option; in
              that case search commands do not turn highlighting back on.)

       &pattern
              Display  only  lines which match the pattern; lines which do not
              match the pattern are not displayed.  If pattern  is  empty  (if
              you  type  &  immediately  followed  by ENTER), any filtering is
              turned off, and all lines are displayed.  While filtering is  in
              effect,  an  ampersand  is  displayed  at  the  beginning of the
              prompt, as a reminder that some lines in the file may be hidden.

              Certain characters are special as in the / command:

              ^N or !
                     Display only lines which do NOT match the pattern.

              ^R     Don't  interpret  regular expression metacharacters; that
                     is, do a simple textual comparison.

       :e [filename]
              Examine a new file.  If the filename is missing,  the  ""current""
              file  (see  the :n and :p commands below) from the list of files
              in the command line is re-examined.  A percent sign (%)  in  the
              filename  is  replaced by the name of the current file.  A pound
              sign (#) is replaced by the  name  of  the  previously  examined
              file.    However,  two  consecutive  percent  signs  are  simply
              replaced with a single percent sign.  This allows you to enter a
              filename  that  contains a percent sign in the name.  Similarly,
              two consecutive pound signs are replaced  with  a  single  pound
              sign.   The  filename  is inserted into the command line list of
              files so that it can be seen by subsequent :n and  :p  commands.
              If the filename consists of several files, they are all inserted
              into the list of files and the first one is  examined.   If  the
              filename contains one or more spaces, the entire filename should
              be enclosed in double quotes (also see the -"" option).

       ^X^V or E
              Same as :e.  Warning: some systems use ^V as a special  literal-
              ization  character.  On such systems, you may not be able to use
              ^V.

       :n     Examine the next file (from the list of files given in the  com-
              mand  line).   If a number N is specified, the N-th next file is
              examined.

       :p     Examine the previous file in the command line list.  If a number
              N is specified, the N-th previous file is examined.

       :x     Examine  the first file in the command line list.  If a number N
              is specified, the N-th file in the list is examined.

       :d     Remove the current file from the list of files.

       t      Go to the next tag, if there were more than one matches for  the
              current tag.  See the -t option for more details about tags.

       T      Go  to the previous tag, if there were more than one matches for
              the current tag.

       = or ^G or :f
              Prints some information about the file being  viewed,  including
              its  name and the line number and byte offset of the bottom line
              being displayed.  If possible, it also prints the length of  the
              file,  the  number  of  lines in the file and the percent of the
              file above the last displayed line.

       -      Followed by one of the command line option letters (see  OPTIONS
              below),  this will change the setting of that option and print a
              message describing the new setting.   If  a  ^P  (CONTROL-P)  is
              entered immediately after the dash, the setting of the option is
              changed but no message is printed.  If the option letter  has  a
              numeric  value (such as -b or -h), or a string value (such as -P
              or -t), a new value may be entered after the option letter.   If
              no  new  value is entered, a message describing the current set-
              ting is printed and nothing is changed.

       --     Like the - command, but takes a long option  name  (see  OPTIONS
              below) rather than a single option letter.  You must press ENTER
              or RETURN after typing the option name.  A ^P immediately  after
              the  second dash suppresses printing of a message describing the
              new setting, as in the - command.

       -+     Followed by one of the command line  option  letters  this  will
              reset  the  option  to  its  default setting and print a message
              describing the new setting.  (The ""-+_X"" command  does  the  same
              thing  as  ""-+_X""  on  the command line.)  This does not work for
              string-valued options.

       --+    Like the -+ command, but takes a long option name rather than  a
              single option letter.

       -!     Followed  by  one  of the command line option letters, this will
              reset the option to the ""opposite"" of its  default  setting  and
              print  a message describing the new setting.  This does not work
              for numeric or string-valued options.

       --!    Like the -! command, but takes a long option name rather than  a
              single option letter.

       _      (Underscore.)   Followed  by one of the command line option let-
              ters, this will print a message describing the  current  setting
              of that option.  The setting of the option is not changed.

       __     (Double underscore.)  Like the _ (underscore) command, but takes
              a long option name rather than a single option letter.  You must
              press ENTER or RETURN after typing the option name.

       +cmd   Causes  the specified cmd to be executed each time a new file is
              examined.  For example, +G causes _l_e_s_s to initially display each
              file starting at the end rather than the beginning.

       V      Prints the version number of _l_e_s_s being run.

       q or Q or :q or :Q or ZZ
              Exits _l_e_s_s_.

       The  following four commands may or may not be valid, depending on your
       particular installation.


       v      Invokes an editor to edit the current file  being  viewed.   The
              editor is taken from the environment variable VISUAL if defined,
              or EDITOR if VISUAL is not defined, or defaults to ""vi"" if  nei-
              ther  VISUAL  nor EDITOR is defined.  See also the discussion of
              LESSEDIT under the section on PROMPTS below.

       ! shell-command
              Invokes a shell to run the shell-command given.  A percent  sign
              (%)  in the command is replaced by the name of the current file.
              A pound sign (#) is replaced by the name of the previously exam-
              ined  file.   ""!!""  repeats the last shell command.  ""!"" with no
              shell command simply invokes a  shell.   On  Unix  systems,  the
              shell  is taken from the environment variable SHELL, or defaults
              to ""sh"".  On MS-DOS and OS/2 systems, the shell  is  the  normal
              command processor.

       | <m> shell-command
              <m>  represents  any  mark letter.  Pipes a section of the input
              file to the given shell command.  The section of the file to  be
              piped  is  between  the first line on the current screen and the
              position marked by the letter.  <m> may also be ^ or $ to  indi-
              cate beginning or end of file respectively.  If <m> is . or new-
              line, the current screen is piped.

       s filename
              Save the input to a file.  This only works if  the  input  is  a
              pipe, not an ordinary file.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Command  line options are described below.  Most options may be changed
       while _l_e_s_s is running, via the ""-"" command.

       Most options may be given in one of two forms: either a  dash  followed
       by  a  single  letter, or two dashes followed by a long option name.  A
       long option name may be abbreviated as  long  as  the  abbreviation  is
       unambiguous.  For example, --quit-at-eof may be abbreviated --quit, but
       not --qui, since both --quit-at-eof and --quiet begin with --qui.  Some
       long  option names are in uppercase, such as --QUIT-AT-EOF, as distinct
       from --quit-at-eof.  Such option names need only have their first  let-
       ter  capitalized; the remainder of the name may be in either case.  For
       example, --Quit-at-eof is equivalent to --QUIT-AT-EOF.

       Options are also taken from the environment variable ""LESS"".  For exam-
       ple, to avoid typing ""less -options ..."" each time _l_e_s_s is invoked, you
       might tell _c_s_h_:

       setenv LESS ""-options""

       or if you use _s_h_:

       LESS=""-options""; export LESS

       On MS-DOS, you don't need the quotes, but you should replace  any  per-
       cent signs in the options string by double percent signs.

       The  environment variable is parsed before the command line, so command
       line options override the LESS  environment  variable.   If  an  option
       appears  in  the LESS variable, it can be reset to its default value on
       the command line by beginning the command line option with ""-+"".

       Some options like -k or -D require a string to follow the  option  let-
       ter.   The  string  for  that option is considered to end when a dollar
       sign ($) is found.  For example, you can set two -D options  on  MS-DOS
       like this:

       LESS=""Dn9.1$Ds4.1""

       If  the  --use-backslash  option appears earlier in the options, then a
       dollar sign or backslash may be included literally in an option  string
       by preceding it with a backslash.  If the --use-backslash option is not
       in effect, then backslashes are not treated specially, and there is  no
       way to include a dollar sign in the option string.

       -? or --help
              This  option displays a summary of the commands accepted by _l_e_s_s
              (the same as the h  command).   (Depending  on  how  your  shell
              interprets  the  question mark, it may be necessary to quote the
              question mark, thus: ""-\?"".)

       -a or --search-skip-screen
              By default, forward searches start at the top of  the  displayed
              screen  and  backwards  searches start at the bottom of the dis-
              played screen (except for repeated searches invoked by the n  or
              N  commands,  which  start  after  or  before  the ""target"" line
              respectively; see the -j option for more about the target line).
              The  -a  option  causes forward searches to instead start at the
              bottom of the screen and backward searches to start at  the  top
              of  the screen, thus skipping all lines displayed on the screen.

       -A or --SEARCH-SKIP-SCREEN
              Causes all forward searches (not just non-repeated searches)  to
              start  just  after the target line, and all backward searches to
              start just before the target line.  Thus, forward searches  will
              skip part of the displayed screen (from the first line up to and
              including the target line).  Similarly backwards  searches  will
              skip the displayed screen from the last line up to and including
              the target line.  This was the default behavior in less versions
              prior to 441.

       -b_n or --buffers=_n
              Specifies  the  amount  of  buffer  space _l_e_s_s will use for each
              file, in units of kilobytes (1024 bytes).  By  default  64 K  of
              buffer  space  is used for each file (unless the file is a pipe;
              see the -B option).  The -b  option  specifies  instead  that  _n
              kilobytes of buffer space should be used for each file.  If _n is
              -1, buffer space is unlimited; that is, the entire file  can  be
              read into memory.

       -B or --auto-buffers
              By default, when data is read from a pipe, buffers are allocated
              automatically as needed.  If a large amount of data is read from
              the  pipe,  this  can cause a large amount of memory to be allo-
              cated.  The -B option  disables  this  automatic  allocation  of
              buffers  for  pipes,  so  that only 64 K (or the amount of space
              specified by the -b option) is used for the pipe.  Warning:  use
              of  -B  can  result  in  erroneous  display, since only the most
              recently viewed part of the piped data is kept  in  memory;  any
              earlier data is lost.

       -c or --clear-screen
              Causes  full  screen  repaints  to  be painted from the top line
              down.  By default, full screen repaints are  done  by  scrolling
              from the bottom of the screen.

       -C or --CLEAR-SCREEN
              Same as -c, for compatibility with older versions of _l_e_s_s_.

       -d or --dumb
              The -d option suppresses the error message normally displayed if
              the terminal is dumb; that is, lacks some important  capability,
              such as the ability to clear the screen or scroll backward.  The
              -d option does not otherwise change the behavior of  _l_e_s_s  on  a
              dumb terminal.

       -Dxx_c_o_l_o_r or --color=xx_c_o_l_o_r
              [MS-DOS only] Sets the color of the text displayed.  xx is a sin-
              gle character which selects the type  of  text  whose  color  is
              being  set: n=normal, s=standout, d=bold, u=underlined, k=blink.
              _c_o_l_o_r is a pair of numbers separated by  a  period.   The  first
              number  selects  the foreground color and the second selects the
              background color of the text.  A single number _N is the same  as
              _N_._M, where _M is the normal background color.  xx may also be aa to
              toggle strict ANSI sequence rendering (SGR mode).


       -e or --quit-at-eof
              Causes _l_e_s_s to automatically exit the  second  time  it  reaches
              end-of-file.   By  default, the only way to exit _l_e_s_s is via the
              ""q"" command.

       -E or --QUIT-AT-EOF
              Causes _l_e_s_s to automatically exit the first time it reaches end-
              of-file.

       -f or --force
              Forces non-regular files to be opened.  (A non-regular file is a
              directory or a device special file.)  Also suppresses the  warn-
              ing message when a binary file is opened.  By default, _l_e_s_s will
              refuse to open non-regular files.  Note that some operating sys-
              tems will not allow directories to be read, even if -f is set.

       -F or --quit-if-one-screen
              Causes _l_e_s_s to automatically exit if the entire file can be dis-
              played on the first screen.

       -g or --hilite-search
              Normally, _l_e_s_s will highlight ALL strings which match  the  last
              search  command.   The  -g option changes this behavior to high-
              light only the particular string which was  found  by  the  last
              search command.  This can cause _l_e_s_s to run somewhat faster than
              the default.

       -G or --HILITE-SEARCH
              The -G option suppresses all highlighting of  strings  found  by
              search commands.

       -h_n or --max-back-scroll=_n
              Specifies  a  maximum number of lines to scroll backward.  If it
              is necessary to scroll backward more than _n lines, the screen is
              repainted in a forward direction instead.  (If the terminal does
              not have the ability to scroll backward, -h0 is implied.)

       -i or --ignore-case
              Causes searches to ignore case; that is, uppercase and lowercase
              are  considered identical.  This option is ignored if any upper-
              case letters appear in the search pattern; in other words, if  a
              pattern  contains  uppercase  letters, then that search does not
              ignore case.

       -I or --IGNORE-CASE
              Like -i, but searches ignore case even if the  pattern  contains
              uppercase letters.

       -j_n or --jump-target=_n
              Specifies  a line on the screen where the ""target"" line is to be
              positioned.  The target line is the line specified by  any  com-
              mand  to  search for a pattern, jump to a line number, jump to a
              file percentage or jump to a tag.  The screen line may be speci-
              fied  by  a number: the top line on the screen is 1, the next is
              2, and so on.  The number may be negative to specify a line rel-
              ative to the bottom of the screen: the bottom line on the screen
              is -1, the second to the bottom is -2, and so on.   Alternately,
              the  screen line may be specified as a fraction of the height of
              the screen, starting with a decimal point: .5 is in  the  middle
              of  the screen, .3 is three tenths down from the first line, and
              so on.  If the line is specified as a fraction, the actual  line
              number  is  recalculated  if  the terminal window is resized, so
              that the target line remains at the specified  fraction  of  the
              screen  height.   If any form of the -j option is used, repeated
              forward searches (invoked with ""n"" or ""N"")  begin  at  the  line
              immediately   after  the  target  line,  and  repeated  backward
              searches begin at the target line, unless changed by -a  or  -A.
              For  example,  if  ""-j4""  is used, the target line is the fourth
              line on the screen, so forward searches begin at the fifth  line
              on  the  screen.  However nonrepeated searches (invoked with ""/""
              or ""?"")  always begin at the start or end of the current  screen
              respectively.

       -J or --status-column
              Displays  a  status  column at the left edge of the screen.  The
              status column shows the lines that matched the  current  search.
              The  status  column  is  also  used if the -w or -W option is in
              effect.

       -k_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e or --lesskey-file=_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Causes _l_e_s_s to open and interpret the named file  as  a  _l_e_s_s_k_e_y
              (1) file.  Multiple -k options may be specified.  If the LESSKEY
              or LESSKEY_SYSTEM environment variable is set, or if  a  lesskey
              file is found in a standard place (see KEY BINDINGS), it is also
              used as a _l_e_s_s_k_e_y file.

       -K or --quit-on-intr
              Causes _l_e_s_s to exit immediately (with status 2) when  an  inter-
              rupt  character  (usually  ^C) is typed.  Normally, an interrupt
              character causes _l_e_s_s to stop whatever it is doing and return to
              its  command  prompt.   Note  that  use  of this option makes it
              impossible to return to the command prompt from the ""F"" command.

       -L or --no-lessopen
              Ignore  the  LESSOPEN  environment  variable (see the INPUT PRE-
              PROCESSOR section below).  This option can be  set  from  within
              _l_e_s_s,  but  it will apply only to files opened subsequently, not
              to the file which is currently open.

       -m or --long-prompt
              Causes _l_e_s_s to prompt verbosely (like _m_o_r_e),  with  the  percent
              into the file.  By default, _l_e_s_s prompts with a colon.

       -M or --LONG-PROMPT
              Causes _l_e_s_s to prompt even more verbosely than _m_o_r_e_.

       -n or --line-numbers
              Suppresses  line numbers.  The default (to use line numbers) may
              cause _l_e_s_s to run more slowly in some cases, especially  with  a
              very  large  input  file.   Suppressing line numbers with the -n
              option will avoid this problem.  Using line numbers  means:  the
              line number will be displayed in the verbose prompt and in the =
              command, and the v command will pass the current line number  to
              the  editor  (see  also  the  discussion  of LESSEDIT in PROMPTS
              below).

       -N or --LINE-NUMBERS
              Causes a line number to be displayed at the  beginning  of  each
              line in the display.

       -o_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e or --log-file=_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Causes  _l_e_s_s  to copy its input to the named file as it is being
              viewed.  This applies only when the input file is a pipe, not an
              ordinary  file.   If  the file already exists, _l_e_s_s will ask for
              confirmation before overwriting it.

       -O_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e or --LOG-FILE=_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              The -O option is like -o, but it will overwrite an existing file
              without asking for confirmation.

              If  no log file has been specified, the -o and -O options can be
              used from within _l_e_s_s to specify a log  file.   Without  a  file
              name, they will simply report the name of the log file.  The ""s""
              command is equivalent to specifying -o from within _l_e_s_s_.

       -p_p_a_t_t_e_r_n or --pattern=_p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              The -p option on the command line is  equivalent  to  specifying
              +/_p_a_t_t_e_r_n;  that  is, it tells _l_e_s_s to start at the first occur-
              rence of _p_a_t_t_e_r_n in the file.

       -P_p_r_o_m_p_t or --prompt=_p_r_o_m_p_t
              Provides a way to tailor the three prompt  styles  to  your  own
              preference.  This option would normally be put in the LESS envi-
              ronment variable, rather than being typed in with each _l_e_s_s com-
              mand.  Such an option must either be the last option in the LESS
              variable, or be terminated by a dollar sign.
               -Ps followed by a string changes the default (short) prompt  to
              that string.
               -Pm changes the medium (-m) prompt.
               -PM changes the long (-M) prompt.
               -Ph changes the prompt for the help screen.
               -P= changes the message printed by the = command.
               -Pw  changes the message printed while waiting for data (in the
              F command).  All prompt strings consist of a sequence of letters
              and  special  escape  sequences.  See the section on PROMPTS for
              more details.

       -q or --quiet or --silent
              Causes moderately ""quiet"" operation: the terminal  bell  is  not
              rung if an attempt is made to scroll past the end of the file or
              before the beginning of the file.  If the terminal has a ""visual
              bell"",  it  is  used  instead.  The bell will be rung on certain
              other errors, such as typing an invalid character.  The  default
              is to ring the terminal bell in all such cases.

       -Q or --QUIET or --SILENT
              Causes  totally  ""quiet""  operation:  the terminal bell is never
              rung.

       -r or --raw-control-chars
              Causes ""raw"" control characters to be displayed.  The default is
              to  display  control  characters  using  the caret notation; for
              example, a control-A (octal 001) is displayed as ""^A"".  Warning:
              when the -r option is used, _l_e_s_s cannot keep track of the actual
              appearance of the screen (since this depends on how  the  screen
              responds to each type of control character).  Thus, various dis-
              play problems may result, such as long lines being split in  the
              wrong place.

       -R or --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS
              Like  -r,  but  only ANSI ""color"" escape sequences are output in
              ""raw"" form.  Unlike -r, the screen appearance is maintained cor-
              rectly  in  most  cases.   ANSI  ""color""  escape  sequences  are
              sequences of the form:

                   ESC [ ... m

              where the ""..."" is zero or more color  specification  characters
              For  the  purpose  of  keeping  track of screen appearance, ANSI
              color escape sequences are assumed to not move the cursor.   You
              can  make _l_e_s_s think that characters other than ""m"" can end ANSI
              color escape  sequences  by  setting  the  environment  variable
              LESSANSIENDCHARS to the list of characters which can end a color
              escape sequence.  And you can make _l_e_s_s  think  that  characters
              other  than the standard ones may appear between the ESC and the
              m by setting the environment variable  LESSANSIMIDCHARS  to  the
              list of characters which can appear.

       -s or --squeeze-blank-lines
              Causes  consecutive  blank  lines  to  be squeezed into a single
              blank line.  This is useful when viewing _n_r_o_f_f output.

       -S or --chop-long-lines
              Causes lines longer than the screen width to be  chopped  (trun-
              cated) rather than wrapped.  That is, the portion of a long line
              that does not fit in the screen width is not shown.  The default
              is  to  wrap  long  lines; that is, display the remainder on the
              next line.

       -t_t_a_g or --tag=_t_a_g
              The -t option, followed immediately by a TAG, will edit the file
              containing  that tag.  For this to work, tag information must be
              available; for example, there may  be  a  file  in  the  current
              directory called ""tags"", which was previously built by _c_t_a_g_s (1)
              or an equivalent command.  If the environment variable LESSGLOB-
              ALTAGS  is set, it is taken to be the name of a command compati-
              ble with _g_l_o_b_a_l (1), and that command is executed  to  find  the
              tag.  (See http://www.gnu.org/software/global/global.html).  The
              -t option may also be specified from within _l_e_s_s  (using  the  -
              command)  as a way of examining a new file.  The command "":t"" is
              equivalent to specifying -t from within _l_e_s_s_.

       -T_t_a_g_s_f_i_l_e or --tag-file=_t_a_g_s_f_i_l_e
              Specifies a tags file to be used instead of ""tags"".

       -u or --underline-special
              Causes backspaces and carriage returns to be treated  as  print-
              able  characters;  that  is,  they are sent to the terminal when
              they appear in the input.

       -U or --UNDERLINE-SPECIAL
              Causes backspaces, tabs and carriage returns to  be  treated  as
              control  characters;  that  is, they are handled as specified by
              the -r option.

              By default, if neither -u nor  -U  is  given,  backspaces  which
              appear  adjacent  to  an  underscore  character are treated spe-
              cially: the underlined text is displayed  using  the  terminal's
              hardware  underlining capability.  Also, backspaces which appear
              between two identical  characters  are  treated  specially:  the
              overstruck  text  is printed using the terminal's hardware bold-
              face capability.  Other backspaces are deleted, along  with  the
              preceding character.  Carriage returns immediately followed by a
              newline are deleted.  Other  carriage  returns  are  handled  as
              specified  by the -r option.  Text which is overstruck or under-
              lined can be searched for if neither -u nor -U is in effect.

       -V or --version
              Displays the version number of _l_e_s_s_.

       -w or --hilite-unread
              Temporarily highlights the first  ""new""  line  after  a  forward
              movement of a full page.  The first ""new"" line is the line imme-
              diately following the line  previously  at  the  bottom  of  the
              screen.  Also highlights the target line after a g or p command.
              The highlight is removed at the next command which causes  move-
              ment.   The  entire line is highlighted, unless the -J option is
              in effect, in which case only the status column is  highlighted.

       -W or --HILITE-UNREAD
              Like -w, but temporarily highlights the first new line after any
              forward movement command larger than one line.

       -x_n,... or --tabs=_n,...
              Sets tab stops.  If only one _n is specified, tab stops  are  set
              at  multiples  of _n.  If multiple values separated by commas are
              specified, tab stops are set at those positions, and  then  con-
              tinue  with  the  same  spacing  as  the last two.  For example,
              _-_x_9_,_1_7 will set tabs at positions  9,  17,  25,  33,  etc.   The
              default for _n is 8.

       -X or --no-init
              Disables sending the termcap initialization and deinitialization
              strings to the terminal.  This is  sometimes  desirable  if  the
              deinitialization  string does something unnecessary, like clear-
              ing the screen.

       -y_n or --max-forw-scroll=_n
              Specifies a maximum number of lines to scroll forward.  If it is
              necessary  to  scroll  forward  more than _n lines, the screen is
              repainted instead.  The -c or -C option may be used  to  repaint
              from  the top of the screen if desired.  By default, any forward
              movement causes scrolling.

       -[z]_n or --window=_n
              Changes the default scrolling  window  size  to  _n  lines.   The
              default is one screenful.  The z and w commands can also be used
              to change the window size.  The ""z"" may be omitted for  compati-
              bility with some versions of _m_o_r_e_.  If the number _n is negative,
              it indicates _n lines less than the  current  screen  size.   For
              example, if the screen is 24 lines, _-_z_-_4 sets the scrolling win-
              dow to 20 lines.  If the screen is  resized  to  40  lines,  the
              scrolling window automatically changes to 36 lines.

       -_""_c_c or --quotes=_c_c
              Changes  the  filename quoting character.  This may be necessary
              if you are trying to name a file which contains both spaces  and
              quote  characters.  Followed by a single character, this changes
              the quote character to that character.  Filenames  containing  a
              space should then be surrounded by that character rather than by
              double quotes.  Followed by two  characters,  changes  the  open
              quote  to the first character, and the close quote to the second
              character.  Filenames containing a space should then be preceded
              by  the  open  quote  character  and followed by the close quote
              character.  Note  that  even  after  the  quote  characters  are
              changed,  this  option  remains  -"" (a dash followed by a double
              quote).

       -~ or --tilde
              Normally lines after end of file are displayed as a single tilde
              (~).  This option causes lines after end of file to be displayed
              as blank lines.

       -# or --shift
              Specifies the default number of positions to scroll horizontally
              in  the RIGHTARROW and LEFTARROW commands.  If the number speci-
              fied is zero, it sets the default number  of  positions  to  one
              half of the screen width.  Alternately, the number may be speci-
              fied as a fraction of the width of the screen, starting  with  a
              decimal  point:  .5  is  half  of  the screen width, .3 is three
              tenths of the screen width, and so on.  If the number is  speci-
              fied  as  a  fraction,  the actual number of scroll positions is
              recalculated if the terminal window  is  resized,  so  that  the
              actual  scroll  remains  at the specified fraction of the screen
              width.

       --follow-name
              Normally, if the input file is renamed while  an  F  command  is
              executing,  _l_e_s_s  will  continue  to display the contents of the
              original file despite its  name  change.   If  --follow-name  is
              specified, during an F command _l_e_s_s will periodically attempt to
              reopen the file by name.  If the reopen succeeds and the file is
              a  different file from the original (which means that a new file
              has been created  with  the  same  name  as  the  original  (now
              renamed) file), _l_e_s_s will display the contents of that new file.

       --no-keypad
              Disables sending the keypad initialization and  deinitialization
              strings to the terminal.  This is sometimes useful if the keypad
              strings make the numeric keypad behave in an undesirable manner.

       --use-backslash
              This  option changes the interpretations of options which follow
              this one.  After the --use-backslash option, any backslash in an
              option  string  is  removed and the following character is taken
              literally.  This allows a dollar sign to be included  in  option
              strings.

       --     A  command  line  argument of ""--"" marks the end of option argu-
              ments.  Any arguments following this are  interpreted  as  file-
              names.  This can be useful when viewing a file whose name begins
              with a ""-"" or ""+"".

       +      If a command line option begins with ++, the  remainder  of  that
              option  is taken to be an initial command to _l_e_s_s_.  For example,
              +G tells _l_e_s_s to start at the end of the file  rather  than  the
              beginning,  and  +/xyz tells it to start at the first occurrence
              of ""xyz"" in the file.  As a special case,  +<number>  acts  like
              +<number>g; that is, it starts the display at the specified line
              number (however, see the caveat under the  ""g""  command  above).
              If  the  option  starts  with ++, the initial command applies to
              every file being viewed, not just the first one.  The +  command
              described previously may also be used to set (or change) an ini-
              tial command for every file.

       When entering command line at the bottom of the screen (for example,  a
       filename for the :e command, or the pattern for a search command), cer-
       tain keys can be used to manipulate the command  line.   Most  commands
       have  an alternate form in [ brackets ] which can be used if a key does
       not exist on a particular keyboard.  (Note  that  the  forms  beginning
       with  ESC do not work in some MS-DOS and Windows systems because ESC is
       the line erase character.)  Any of these special keys  may  be  entered
       literally  by  preceding  it with the ""literal"" character, either ^V or
       ^A.  A backslash itself may also be entered literally by  entering  two
       backslashes.

       LEFTARROW [ ESC-h ]
              Move the cursor one space to the left.

       RIGHTARROW [ ESC-l ]
              Move the cursor one space to the right.

       ^LEFTARROW [ ESC-b or ESC-LEFTARROW ]
              (That  is, CONTROL and LEFTARROW simultaneously.)  Move the cur-
              sor one word to the left.

       ^RIGHTARROW [ ESC-w or ESC-RIGHTARROW ]
              (That is, CONTROL and RIGHTARROW simultaneously.)  Move the cur-
              sor one word to the right.

       HOME [ ESC-0 ]
              Move the cursor to the beginning of the line.

       END [ ESC-$ ]
              Move the cursor to the end of the line.

       BACKSPACE
              Delete  the  character  to the left of the cursor, or cancel the
              command if the command line is empty.

       DELETE or [ ESC-x ]
              Delete the character under the cursor.

       ^BACKSPACE [ ESC-BACKSPACE ]
              (That is, CONTROL and  BACKSPACE  simultaneously.)   Delete  the
              word to the left of the cursor.

       ^DELETE [ ESC-X or ESC-DELETE ]
              (That  is,  CONTROL and DELETE simultaneously.)  Delete the word
              under the cursor.

       UPARROW [ ESC-k ]
              Retrieve the previous command line.  If  you  first  enter  some
              text  and then press UPARROW, it will retrieve the previous com-
              mand which begins with that text.

       DOWNARROW [ ESC-j ]
              Retrieve the next command line.  If you first  enter  some  text
              and  then  press  DOWNARROW,  it  will retrieve the next command
              which begins with that text.

       TAB    Complete the partial filename to the left of the cursor.  If  it
              matches  more than one filename, the first match is entered into
              the command line.  Repeated  TABs  will  cycle  thru  the  other
              matching filenames.  If the completed filename is a directory, a
              ""/"" is appended to the filename.  (On MS-DOS systems, a  ""\""  is
              appended.)   The  environment variable LESSSEPARATOR can be used
              to specify a different character to append to a directory  name.

       BACKTAB [ ESC-TAB ]
              Like, TAB, but cycles in the reverse direction thru the matching
              filenames.

       ^L     Complete the partial filename to the left of the cursor.  If  it
              matches more than one filename, all matches are entered into the
              command line (if they fit).

       ^U (Unix and OS/2) or ESC (MS-DOS)
              Delete the entire command line, or cancel  the  command  if  the
              command line is empty.  If you have changed your line-kill char-
              acter in Unix to something other than ^U, that character is used
              instead of ^U.

       ^G     Delete the entire command line and return to the main prompt.


KKEEYY BBIINNDDIINNGGSS
       You  may define your own _l_e_s_s commands by using the program _l_e_s_s_k_e_y (1)
       to create a lesskey file.  This file specifies a set  of  command  keys
       and  an  action  associated with each key.  You may also use _l_e_s_s_k_e_y to
       change the line-editing keys (see LINE EDITING), and to set environment
       variables.   If the environment variable LESSKEY is set, _l_e_s_s uses that
       as the name of the lesskey file.  Otherwise, _l_e_s_s looks in  a  standard
       place  for  the lesskey file: On Unix systems, _l_e_s_s looks for a lesskey
       file called ""$HOME/.less"".  On MS-DOS and Windows systems,  _l_e_s_s  looks
       for  a lesskey file called ""$HOME/_less"", and if it is not found there,
       then looks for a lesskey file called ""_less"" in any directory specified
       in  the  PATH  environment variable.  On OS/2 systems, _l_e_s_s looks for a
       lesskey file called ""$HOME/less.ini"", and if  it  is  not  found,  then
       looks  for  a lesskey file called ""less.ini"" in any directory specified
       in the INIT environment variable, and if it not found there, then looks
       for  a lesskey file called ""less.ini"" in any directory specified in the
       PATH environment variable.   See  the  _l_e_s_s_k_e_y  manual  page  for  more
       details.

       A  system-wide lesskey file may also be set up to provide key bindings.
       If a key is defined in both a local lesskey file and in the system-wide
       file,  key bindings in the local file take precedence over those in the
       system-wide file.  If the environment variable LESSKEY_SYSTEM  is  set,
       _l_e_s_s uses that as the name of the system-wide lesskey file.  Otherwise,
       _l_e_s_s looks in a standard place for the  system-wide  lesskey  file:  On
       Unix  systems,  the system-wide lesskey file is /usr/local/etc/sysless.
       (However, if _l_e_s_s was built with a  different  sysconf  directory  than
       /usr/local/etc, that directory is where the sysless file is found.)  On
       MS-DOS and Windows systems, the system-wide lesskey  file  is  c:\_sys-
       less.  On OS/2 systems, the system-wide lesskey file is c:\sysless.ini.


IINNPPUUTT PPRREEPPRROOCCEESSSSOORR
       You may define an ""input preprocessor"" for _l_e_s_s_.  Before _l_e_s_s  opens  a
       file, it first gives your input preprocessor a chance to modify the way
       the contents of the file are displayed.  An input preprocessor is  sim-
       ply  an executable program (or shell script), which writes the contents
       of the file to a different file, called the replacement file.  The con-
       tents  of  the replacement file are then displayed in place of the con-
       tents of the original file.  However, it will appear to the user as  if
       the  original  file  is opened; that is, _l_e_s_s will display the original
       filename as the name of the current file.

       An input preprocessor receives one command line argument, the  original
       filename,  as  entered  by  the user.  It should create the replacement
       file, and when finished, print the name of the replacement file to  its
       standard  output.  If the input preprocessor does not output a replace-
       ment filename, _l_e_s_s uses the original file, as normal.  The input  pre-
       processor  is  not  called  when  viewing standard input.  To set up an
       input preprocessor, set the LESSOPEN environment variable to a  command
       line  which  will  invoke  your  input preprocessor.  This command line
       should include one  occurrence  of  the  string  ""%s"",  which  will  be
       replaced  by  the  filename  when  the  input  preprocessor  command is
       invoked.

       When _l_e_s_s closes a file opened in such a way, it will call another pro-
       gram,  called  the  input  postprocessor, which may perform any desired
       clean-up action (such as  deleting  the  replacement  file  created  by
       LESSOPEN).  This program receives two command line arguments, the orig-
       inal filename as entered by the user, and the name of  the  replacement
       file.   To set up an input postprocessor, set the LESSCLOSE environment
       variable to a command line which will invoke your input  postprocessor.
       It  may  include  two  occurrences  of  the  string  ""%s""; the first is
       replaced with the original name of the file and  the  second  with  the
       name of the replacement file, which was output by LESSOPEN.

       For  example, on many Unix systems, these two scripts will allow you to
       keep files in compressed format, but still let _l_e_s_s view them directly:

       lessopen.sh:
            #! /bin/sh
            case ""$1"" in
            *.Z) uncompress -c $1  >/tmp/less.$$  2>/dev/null
                 if [ -s /tmp/less.$$ ]; then
                      echo /tmp/less.$$
                 else
                      rm -f /tmp/less.$$
                 fi
                 ;;
            esac

       lessclose.sh:
            #! /bin/sh
            rm $2

       To  use these scripts, put them both where they can be executed and set
       LESSOPEN=""lessopen.sh %s"",  and  LESSCLOSE=""lessclose.sh %s %s"".   More
       complex  LESSOPEN  and LESSCLOSE scripts may be written to accept other
       types of compressed files, and so on.

       It is also possible to set up an input preprocessor to  pipe  the  file
       data  directly to _l_e_s_s_, rather than putting the data into a replacement
       file.  This avoids the need to decompress the entire file before start-
       ing to view it.  An input preprocessor that works this way is called an
       input pipe.  An input pipe, instead of writing the name of  a  replace-
       ment  file  on  its  standard output, writes the entire contents of the
       replacement file on its standard output.  If the input  pipe  does  not
       write  any characters on its standard output, then there is no replace-
       ment file and _l_e_s_s uses the original file, as normal.  To use an  input
       pipe,  make  the first character in the LESSOPEN environment variable a
       vertical bar (|) to signify that the input  preprocessor  is  an  input
       pipe.

       For  example, on many Unix systems, this script will work like the pre-
       vious example scripts:

       lesspipe.sh:
            #! /bin/sh
            case ""$1"" in
            *.Z) uncompress -c $1  2>/dev/null
            *)   exit 1
                 ;;
            esac
            exit $?

       To  use  this  script,  put  it  where  it  can  be  executed  and  set
       LESSOPEN=""|lesspipe.sh %s"".

       Note  that  a  preprocessor  cannot output an empty file, since that is
       interpreted as meaning there is no replacement, and the  original  file
       is used.  To avoid this, if LESSOPEN starts with two vertical bars, the
       exit status of the script becomes meaningful.  If the  exit  status  is
       zero,  the  output  is  considered  to  be replacement text, even if it
       empty.  If the exit status is nonzero, any output is  ignored  and  the
       original  file  is  used.   For compatibility with previous versions of
       _l_e_s_s_, if LESSOPEN starts with only one vertical bar, the exit status of
       the preprocessor is ignored.

       When  an input pipe is used, a LESSCLOSE postprocessor can be used, but
       it is usually not necessary since there is no replacement file to clean
       up.   In  this  case, the replacement file name passed to the LESSCLOSE
       postprocessor is ""-"".

       For compatibility with previous versions of _l_e_s_s_, the input  preproces-
       sor or pipe is not used if _l_e_s_s is viewing standard input.  However, if
       the first character of LESSOPEN is a dash (-), the  input  preprocessor
       is  used  on  standard input as well as other files.  In this case, the
       dash is not considered to be part  of  the  preprocessor  command.   If
       standard input is being viewed, the input preprocessor is passed a file
       name consisting of a single dash.  Similarly, if the first two  charac-
       ters  of  LESSOPEN  are vertical bar and dash (|-) or two vertical bars
       and a dash (||-), the input pipe is used on standard input as  well  as
       other files.  Again, in this case the dash is not considered to be part
       of the input pipe command.

       There are three types of characters in the input file:

       normal characters
              can be displayed directly to the screen.

       control characters
              should not be displayed directly, but are expected to  be  found
              in ordinary text files (such as backspace and tab).

       binary characters
              should  not  be  displayed  directly  and are not expected to be
              found in text files.

       A ""character set"" is simply a description of which characters are to be
       considered  normal,  control,  and binary.  The LESSCHARSET environment
       variable may be used to select a character set.   Possible  values  for
       LESSCHARSET are:

       ascii  BS,  TAB, NL, CR, and formfeed are control characters, all chars
              with values between 32 and 126 are normal, and  all  others  are
              binary.

       iso8859
              Selects  an  ISO 8859 character set.  This is the same as ASCII,
              except characters between 160 and  255  are  treated  as  normal
              characters.

       latin1 Same as iso8859.

       latin9 Same as iso8859.

       dos    Selects a character set appropriate for MS-DOS.

       ebcdic Selects an EBCDIC character set.

       IBM-1047
              Selects  an  EBCDIC  character set used by OS/390 Unix Services.
              This is the EBCDIC analogue of latin1.  You get similar  results
              by setting either LESSCHARSET=IBM-1047 or LC_CTYPE=en_US in your
              environment.

       koi8-r Selects a Russian character set.

       next   Selects a character set appropriate for NeXT computers.

       utf-8  Selects the UTF-8 encoding  of  the  ISO  10646  character  set.
              UTF-8  is  special  in that it supports multi-byte characters in
              the input file.  It is the  only  character  set  that  supports
              multi-byte characters.

       windows
              Selects  a  character  set appropriate for Microsoft Windows (cp
              1251).

       In rare cases, it may be desired to tailor _l_e_s_s to use a character  set
       other  than the ones definable by LESSCHARSET.  In this case, the envi-
       ronment variable LESSCHARDEF can be used to define a character set.  It
       should be set to a string where each character in the string represents
       one character in the character set.  The character ""."" is  used  for  a
       normal  character, ""c"" for control, and ""b"" for binary.  A decimal num-
       ber may be used for repetition.   For  example,  ""bccc4b.""  would  mean
       character  0  is  binary,  1,  2  and  3 are control, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are
       binary, and 8 is normal.  All characters after the last are taken to be
       the  same  as  the  last,  so characters 9 through 255 would be normal.
       (This is an example, and does not necessarily represent any real  char-
       acter set.)

       This  table  shows the value of LESSCHARDEF which is equivalent to each
       of the possible values for LESSCHARSET:

            ascii     8bcccbcc18b95.b
            dos       8bcccbcc12bc5b95.b.
            ebcdic    5bc6bcc7bcc41b.9b7.9b5.b..8b6.10b6.b9.7b
                      9.8b8.17b3.3b9.7b9.8b8.6b10.b.b.b.
            IBM-1047  4cbcbc3b9cbccbccbb4c6bcc5b3cbbc4bc4bccbc
                      191.b
            iso8859   8bcccbcc18b95.33b.
            koi8-r    8bcccbcc18b95.b128.
            latin1    8bcccbcc18b95.33b.
            next      8bcccbcc18b95.bb125.bb

       If neither LESSCHARSET nor LESSCHARDEF is set, but any of  the  strings
       ""UTF-8"",  ""UTF8"", ""utf-8"" or ""utf8"" is found in the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE or
       LANG environment variables, then the default character set is utf-8.

       If that string is not found, but your  system  supports  the  _s_e_t_l_o_c_a_l_e
       interface,  _l_e_s_s  will  use  setlocale  to determine the character set.
       setlocale is controlled by setting the  LANG  or  LC_CTYPE  environment
       variables.

       Finally,  if the _s_e_t_l_o_c_a_l_e interface is also not available, the default
       character set is latin1.

       Control and  binary  characters  are  displayed  in  standout  (reverse
       video).  Each such character is displayed in caret notation if possible
       (e.g. ^A for control-A).  Caret notation is used only if inverting  the
       0100 bit results in a normal printable character.  Otherwise, the char-
       acter is displayed as a hex number in angle brackets.  This format  can
       be  changed by setting the LESSBINFMT environment variable.  LESSBINFMT
       may begin with a ""*"" and one character to select the display attribute:
       ""*k""  is  blinking, ""*d"" is bold, ""*u"" is underlined, ""*s"" is standout,
       and ""*n"" is normal.  If LESSBINFMT does not begin with  a  ""*"",  normal
       attribute  is  assumed.   The remainder of LESSBINFMT is a string which
       may include one printf-style escape sequence (a % followed by x, X,  o,
       d,  etc.).   For  example, if LESSBINFMT is ""*u[%x]"", binary characters
       are displayed in underlined hexadecimal surrounded  by  brackets.   The
       default  if  no  LESSBINFMT  is  specified is ""*s<%02X>"".  Warning: the
       result of expanding the character via LESSBINFMT must be less  than  31
       characters.

       When the character set is utf-8, the LESSUTFBINFMT environment variable
       acts similarly to LESSBINFMT but it applies to Unicode code points that
       were  successfully  decoded but are unsuitable for display (e.g., unas-
       signed code points).  Its default  value  is  ""<U+%04lX>"".   Note  that
       LESSUTFBINFMT  and  LESSBINFMT  share  their  display attribute setting
       (""*x"") so specifying one will affect both; LESSUTFBINFMT is read  after
       LESSBINFMT  so  its  setting,  if any, will have priority.  Problematic
       octets in a UTF-8 file (octets of a truncated  sequence,  octets  of  a
       complete  but  non-shortest  form  sequence,  illegal octets, and stray
       trailing octets) are displayed individually using LESSBINFMT so  as  to
       facilitate diagnostic of how the UTF-8 file is ill-formed.


PPRROOMMPPTTSS
       The  -P option allows you to tailor the prompt to your preference.  The
       string given to the -P option replaces  the  specified  prompt  string.
       Certain characters in the string are interpreted specially.  The prompt
       mechanism is rather complicated to provide flexibility, but  the  ordi-
       nary  user need not understand the details of constructing personalized
       prompt strings.

       A percent sign followed by a single character is expanded according  to
       what the following character is:

       %b_X    Replaced  by the byte offset into the current input file.  The b
              is followed by a single character (shown as _X above) which spec-
              ifies  the line whose byte offset is to be used.  If the charac-
              ter is a ""t"", the byte offset of the top line in the display  is
              used, an ""m"" means use the middle line, a ""b"" means use the bot-
              tom line, a ""B"" means use the line just after the  bottom  line,
              and  a  ""j""  means use the ""target"" line, as specified by the -j
              option.

       %B     Replaced by the size of the current input file.

       %c     Replaced by the column number of the text appearing in the first
              column of the screen.

       %d_X    Replaced  by  the  page number of a line in the input file.  The
              line to be used is determined by the _X, as with the %b option.

       %D     Replaced by the number of pages in the input  file,  or  equiva-
              lently, the page number of the last line in the input file.

       %E     Replaced  by the name of the editor (from the VISUAL environment
              variable, or the EDITOR environment variable if  VISUAL  is  not
              defined).  See the discussion of the LESSEDIT feature below.

       %f     Replaced by the name of the current input file.

       %F     Replaced  by the last component of the name of the current input
              file.

       %i     Replaced by the index of the current file in the list  of  input
              files.

       %l_X    Replaced  by  the  line number of a line in the input file.  The
              line to be used is determined by the _X, as with the %b option.

       %L     Replaced by the line number of the last line in the input  file.

       %m     Replaced by the total number of input files.

       %p_X    Replaced  by  the  percent into the current input file, based on
              byte offsets.  The line used is determined by the _X as with  the
              %b option.

       %P_X    Replaced  by  the  percent into the current input file, based on
              line numbers.  The line used is determined by the _X as with  the
              %b option.

       %s     Same as %B.

       %t     Causes  any  trailing spaces to be removed.  Usually used at the
              end of the string, but may appear anywhere.

       %T     Normally expands to the word ""file"".  However if  viewing  files
              via  a  tags  list  using  the -t option, it expands to the word
              ""tag"".

       %x     Replaced by the name of the next input file in the list.

       If any item is unknown (for example, the file size if input is a pipe),
       a question mark is printed instead.

       The  format  of  the  prompt string can be changed depending on certain
       conditions.  A question mark followed by a single character  acts  like
       an  ""IF"":  depending  on the following character, a condition is evalu-
       ated.  If the condition is true, any characters following the  question
       mark  and  condition  character,  up  to  a period, are included in the
       prompt.  If the condition is false, such characters are  not  included.
       A  colon appearing between the question mark and the period can be used
       to establish an ""ELSE"": any characters between the colon and the period
       are  included  in  the string if and only if the IF condition is false.
       Condition characters (which follow a question mark) may be:

       ?a     True if any characters have been included in the prompt so  far.

       ?b_X    True if the byte offset of the specified line is known.

       ?B     True if the size of current input file is known.

       ?c     True if the text is horizontally shifted (%c is not zero).

       ?d_X    True if the page number of the specified line is known.

       ?e     True if at end-of-file.

       ?f     True  if  there is an input filename (that is, if input is not a
              pipe).

       ?l_X    True if the line number of the specified line is known.

       ?L     True if the line number of the last line in the file is known.

       ?m     True if there is more than one input file.

       ?n     True if this is the first prompt in a new input file.

       ?p_X    True if the percent into the current input file, based  on  byte
              offsets, of the specified line is known.

       ?P_X    True  if  the percent into the current input file, based on line
              numbers, of the specified line is known.

       ?s     Same as ""?B"".

       ?x     True if there is a next input file  (that  is,  if  the  current
              input file is not the last one).

       Any  characters  other  than  the  special  ones (question mark, colon,
       period, percent, and backslash) become literally part  of  the  prompt.
       Any  of  the special characters may be included in the prompt literally
       by preceding it with a backslash.

       Some examples:

       ?f%f:Standard input.

       This prompt prints the filename, if known; otherwise the string  ""Stan-
       dard input"".

       ?f%f .?ltLine %lt:?pt%pt\%:?btByte %bt:-...

       This  prompt  would print the filename, if known.  The filename is fol-
       lowed by the line number, if known, otherwise  the  percent  if  known,
       otherwise  the  byte  offset  if  known.  Otherwise, a dash is printed.
       Notice how each question mark has a matching  period,  and  how  the  %
       after the %pt is included literally by escaping it with a backslash.

       ?n?f%f .?m(%T %i of %m) ..?e(END) ?x- Next\: %x..%t"";

       This  prints  the  filename if this is the first prompt in a file, fol-
       lowed by the ""file N of N"" message if there  is  more  than  one  input
       file.   Then,  if  we are at end-of-file, the string ""(END)"" is printed
       followed by the name of the next file, if there is one.   Finally,  any
       trailing spaces are truncated.  This is the default prompt.  For refer-
       ence, here are the defaults for  the  other  two  prompts  (-m  and  -M
       respectively).   Each  is  broken  into  two lines here for readability
       only.

       ?n?f%f .?m(%T %i of %m) ..?e(END) ?x- Next\: %x.:
            ?pB%pB\%:byte %bB?s/%s...%t

       ?f%f .?n?m(%T %i of %m) ..?ltlines %lt-%lb?L/%L. :
            byte %bB?s/%s. .?e(END) ?x- Next\: %x.:?pB%pB\%..%t

       And here is the default message produced by the = command:

       ?f%f .?m(%T %i of %m) .?ltlines %lt-%lb?L/%L. .
            byte %bB?s/%s. ?e(END) :?pB%pB\%..%t

       The prompt expansion features are also used for another purpose: if  an
       environment  variable LESSEDIT is defined, it is used as the command to
       be executed when the v command is  invoked.   The  LESSEDIT  string  is
       expanded  in the same way as the prompt strings.  The default value for
       LESSEDIT is:

            %E ?lm+%lm. %f

       Note that this expands to the editor name, followed by a + and the line
       number,  followed by the file name.  If your editor does not accept the
       ""+linenumber"" syntax, or has other differences  in  invocation  syntax,
       the LESSEDIT variable can be changed to modify this default.


SSEECCUURRIITTYY
       When  the  environment  variable LESSSECURE is set to 1, _l_e_s_s runs in a
       ""secure"" mode.  This means these features are disabled:

              !      the shell command

              |      the pipe command

              :e     the examine command.

              v      the editing command

              s  -o  log files

              -k     use of lesskey files

              -t     use of tags files

                     metacharacters in filenames, such as *

                     filename completion (TAB, ^L)

       Less can also be compiled to be permanently in ""secure"" mode.

       If the environment variable LESS_IS_MORE is set to 1, or if the program
       is  invoked via a file link named ""more"", _l_e_s_s behaves (mostly) in con-
       formance with the POSIX ""more"" command specification.   In  this  mode,
       less behaves differently in these ways:

       The  -e  option  works  differently.  If the -e option is not set, _l_e_s_s
       behaves as if the -e option were set.  If the -e option  is  set,  _l_e_s_s
       behaves as if the -E option were set.

       The  -m  option  works  differently.   If the -m option is not set, the
       medium prompt is used, and it is prefixed with the  string  ""--More--"".
       If the -m option is set, the short prompt is used.

       The  -n  option acts like the -z option.  The normal behavior of the -n
       option is unavailable in this mode.

       The parameter to the -p option is taken to be  a  _l_e_s_s  command  rather
       than a search pattern.

       The  LESS  environment  variable  is  ignored, and the MORE environment
       variable is used in its place.

       Environment variables may be specified either in the system environment
       as  usual,  or  in  a  _l_e_s_s_k_e_y  (1) file.  If environment variables are
       defined in more than one place, variables defined in  a  local  lesskey
       file  take precedence over variables defined in the system environment,
       which take precedence over variables defined in the system-wide lesskey
       file.

       COLUMNS
              Sets the number of columns on the screen.  Takes precedence over
              the number of columns specified by the TERM variable.   (But  if
              you  have  a  windowing  system  which  supports  TIOCGWINSZ  or
              WIOCGETD, the window system's idea  of  the  screen  size  takes
              precedence over the LINES and COLUMNS environment variables.)

       EDITOR The name of the editor (used for the v command).

       HOME   Name  of  the user's home directory (used to find a lesskey file
              on Unix and OS/2 systems).

       HOMEDRIVE, HOMEPATH
              Concatenation of the HOMEDRIVE and  HOMEPATH  environment  vari-
              ables is the name of the user's home directory if the HOME vari-
              able is not set (only in the Windows version).

       INIT   Name of the user's init directory (used to find a  lesskey  file
              on OS/2 systems).

       LANG   Language for determining the character set.

       LC_CTYPE
              Language for determining the character set.

       LESS   Options which are passed to _l_e_s_s automatically.

       LESSANSIENDCHARS
              Characters  which may end an ANSI color escape sequence (default
              ""m"").

       LESSANSIMIDCHARS
              Characters which may appear between the ESC  character  and  the
              end   character  in  an  ANSI  color  escape  sequence  (default
              ""0123456789:;[?!""'#%()*+ "".

       LESSBINFMT
              Format for displaying non-printable, non-control characters.

       LESSCHARDEF
              Defines a character set.

       LESSCLOSE
              Command line to invoke the (optional) input-postprocessor.

       LESSECHO
              Name of the lessecho program (default ""lessecho"").  The lessecho
              program  is needed to expand metacharacters, such as * and ?, in
              filenames on Unix systems.

       LESSEDIT
              Editor prototype string (used for the v command).   See  discus-
              sion under PROMPTS.

       LESSGLOBALTAGS
              Name  of  the command used by the -t option to find global tags.
              Normally should be set to ""global"" if your system has the _g_l_o_b_a_l
              (1) command.  If not set, global tags are not used.

       LESSHISTFILE
              Name  of  the  history file used to remember search commands and
              shell commands between invocations of _l_e_s_s_.  If set  to  ""-""  or
              ""/dev/null"",  a  history  file  is  not  used.   The  default is
              ""$HOME/.lesshst"" on Unix systems, ""$HOME/_lesshst""  on  DOS  and
              Windows  systems,  or ""$HOME/lesshst.ini"" or ""$INIT/lesshst.ini""
              on OS/2 systems.

       LESSHISTSIZE
              The maximum number of commands to save in the history file.  The
              default is 100.

       LESSKEY
              Name of the default lesskey(1) file.

       LESSKEY_SYSTEM
              Name of the default system-wide lesskey(1) file.

       LESSMETACHARS
              List  of characters which are considered ""metacharacters"" by the
              shell.

       LESSMETAESCAPE
              Prefix which less will add before each metacharacter in  a  com-
              mand  sent  to the shell.  If LESSMETAESCAPE is an empty string,
              commands containing metacharacters will not  be  passed  to  the
              shell.

       LESSOPEN
              Command line to invoke the (optional) input-preprocessor.

       LESSSECURE
              Runs less in ""secure"" mode.  See discussion under SECURITY.

       LESSSEPARATOR
              String  to  be  appended to a directory name in filename comple-
              tion.

              Emulate the _m_o_r_e (1) command.

       LINES  Sets the number of lines on the screen.  Takes  precedence  over
              the number of lines specified by the TERM variable.  (But if you
              have a windowing system which supports TIOCGWINSZ  or  WIOCGETD,
              the  window  system's  idea  of the screen size takes precedence
              over the LINES and COLUMNS environment variables.)

       MORE   Options which are passed to _l_e_s_s automatically when  running  in
              _m_o_r_e compatible mode.

       PATH   User's  search  path  (used to find a lesskey file on MS-DOS and
              OS/2 systems).

       SHELL  The shell used to execute the ! command, as well  as  to  expand
              filenames.

     The mmkkddiirr utility creates the directories named as operands, in the order
     specified, using mode rwxrwxrwx (0777) as modified by the current
     umask(2).

     The options are as follows:

     --mm _m_o_d_e
             Set the file permission bits of the final created directory to
             the specified mode.  The _m_o_d_e argument can be in any of the for-
             mats specified to the chmod(1) command.  If a symbolic mode is
             specified, the operation characters ``+'' and ``-'' are inter-
             preted relative to an initial mode of ``a=rwx''.

     --pp      Create intermediate directories as required.  If this option is
             not specified, the full path prefix of each operand must already
             exist.  On the other hand, with this option specified, no error
             will be reported if a directory given as an operand already
             exists.  Intermediate directories are created with permission
             bits of rwxrwxrwx (0777) as modified by the current umask, plus
             write and search permission for the owner.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

     The eexxppaanndd utility processes the named files or the standard input writ-
     ing the standard output with tabs changed into blanks.  Backspace charac-
     ters are preserved into the output and decrement the column count for tab
     calculations.  The eexxppaanndd utility is useful for pre-processing character
     files (before sorting, looking at specific columns, etc.) that contain
     tabs.

     The uunneexxppaanndd utility puts tabs back into the data from the standard input
     or the named files and writes the result on the standard output.

     The following options are available:

     --aa      (uunneexxppaanndd only.)  By default, only leading blanks and tabs are
             reconverted to maximal strings of tabs.  If the --aa option is
             given, then tabs are inserted whenever they would compress the
             resultant file by replacing two or more characters.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The ftp package provides the client side of the ftp protocol as  speci-
       fied  in RFC 959 (_h_t_t_p_:_/_/_w_w_w_._r_f_c_-_e_d_i_t_o_r_._o_r_g_/_r_f_c_/_r_f_c_9_5_9_._t_x_t).  The pack-
       age implements both active (default) and passive ftp sessions.

       A new ftp session is started with the ::::ffttpp::::OOppeenn command. To  shutdown
       an  existing  ftp  session  use  ::::ffttpp::::CClloossee.  All  other commands are
       restricted to usage in an an  open  ftp  session.  They  will  generate
       errors  if they are used out of context.  The ftp package includes file
       and directory manipulating commands for remote sites.  To  perform  the
       same  operations  on  the  local site use commands built into the core,
       like ccdd or ffiillee.

       The output of  the  package  is  controlled  by  two  state  variables,
       ::::ffttpp::::VVEERRBBOOSSEE  and  ::::ffttpp::::DDEEBBUUGG. Setting ::::ffttpp::::VVEERRBBOOSSEE to ""1"" forces
       the package to show all responses from a  remote  server.  The  default
       value  is ""0"". Setting ::::ffttpp::::DDEEBBUUGG to ""1"" enables debugging and forces
       the package to show all return codes, states, state changes and  ""real""
       ftp commands. The default value is ""0"".

       The  command  ::::ffttpp::::DDiissppllaayyMMssgg  is used to show the different messages
       from the ftp session. The setting of ::::ffttpp::::VVEERRBBOOSSEE determines if  this
       command  is  called  or  not. The current implementation of the command
       uses the lloogg package of tcllib to write the  messages  to  their  final
       destination.  This means that the behaviour of ::::ffttpp::::DDiissppllaayyMMssgg can be
       customized  without  changing  its  implementation.  For  more  radical
       changes  overwriting its implementation by the application is of course
       still possible. Note that the default implementation honors the  option
       --oouuttppuutt to ::::ffttpp::::OOppeenn for a session specific log command.

       _C_a_u_t_i_o_n:  The default implementation logs error messages like all other
       messages. If this behaviour is changed to throwing an error instead all
       commands  in  the  API  will change their behaviour too. In such a case
       they will not return a failure code as described  below  but  pass  the
       thrown error to their caller.

AAPPII
       ::::ffttpp::::OOppeenn _s_e_r_v_e_r _u_s_e_r _p_a_s_s_w_d ?_o_p_t_i_o_n_s?
              This  command  is  used to start a FTP session by establishing a
              control connection to the FTP server. The defaults are used  for
              any option not specified by the caller.

              The  command  takes  a  host name _s_e_r_v_e_r, a user name _u_s_e_r and a
              password _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d as its parameters and returns a session handle
              that  is  an integer number greater than or equal to ""0"", if the
              connection is successfully  established.  Otherwise  it  returns
              ""-1"".  The _s_e_r_v_e_r parameter must be the name or internet address
              (in dotted decimal notation) of the ftp server  to  connect  to.
              The  _u_s_e_r  and  _p_a_s_s_w_d parameters must contain a valid user name
              and password to complete the login process.

              The options overwrite some default values or set special  abili-
              ties:

              --bblloocckkssiizzee _s_i_z_e
                     The  blocksize is used during data transfer. At most _s_i_z_e
                     bytes are transfered at once. The default value for  this
                     option  is 4096.  The package will evaluate the --pprrooggrreessss
                     ccaallllbbaacckk for the  session  after  the  transfer  of  each
                     block.

              --ttiimmeeoouutt _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
                     If  _s_e_c_o_n_d_s is non-zero, then ::::ffttpp::::OOppeenn sets up a time-
                     out which will occur after the specified number  of  sec-
                     onds. The default value is 600.

              --ppoorrtt _n_u_m_b_e_r
                     The  port  _n_u_m_b_e_r specifies an alternative remote port on
                     the ftp server on which the ftp service resides. Most ftp
                     services  listen  for  connection requests on the default
                     port 21. Sometimes, usually for  security  reasons,  port
                     numbers other than 21 are used for ftp connections.

              --mmooddee _m_o_d_e
                     The  transfer  _m_o_d_e  option determines if a file transfer
                     occurs in aaccttiivvee or ppaassssiivvee mode.  In  passive  mode  the
                     client  will  ask the ftp server to listen on a data port
                     and wait for the connection rather than to  initiate  the
                     process  by itself when a data transfer request comes in.
                     Passive mode is normally  a  requirement  when  accessing
                     sites via a firewall. The default mode is aaccttiivvee.

              --pprrooggrreessss _c_a_l_l_b_a_c_k
                     This  _c_a_l_l_b_a_c_k  is evaluated whenever a block of data was
                     transfered. See the option --bblloocckkssiizzee for how to  specify
                     the size of the transfered blocks.

                     When  evaluating the _c_a_l_l_b_a_c_k one argument is appended to
                     the callback script, the current  accumulated  number  of
                     bytes transferred so far.

              --ccoommmmaanndd _c_a_l_l_b_a_c_k
                     Specifying  this  option places the connection into asyn-
                     chronous mode. The _c_a_l_l_b_a_c_k is evaluated after  the  com-
                     pletion of any operation. When an operation is running no
                     further operations must be started until a  callback  has
                     been received for the currently executing operation.

                     When   evaluating  the  _c_a_l_l_b_a_c_k  several  arguments  are
                     appended to the callback script, namely  the  keyword  of
                     the operation that has completed and any additional argu-
                     ments specific to the operation.  If  an  error  occurred
                     during  the  execution  of  the operation the callback is
                     given the keyword eerrrroorr.

              --oouuttppuutt _c_a_l_l_b_a_c_k
                     This option has no default. If  it  is  set  the  default
                     implementation of ::::ffttpp::::DDiissppllaayyMMssgg will use its value as
                     command prefix to log all internal messages. The callback
                     will  have  three arguments appended to it before evalua-
                     tion, the id of the session, the message itself, and  the
                     connection state, in this order.

       ::::ffttpp::::CClloossee _h_a_n_d_l_e
              This  command  terminates  the specified ftp session. If no file
              transfer is in progress, the server will close the control  con-
              nection  immediately. If a file transfer is in progress however,
              the control connection will remain open until the transfers com-
              pletes.  When  that  happens  the  server  will write the result
              response for the transfer to it and close the connection  after-
              ward.

       ::::ffttpp::::CCdd _h_a_n_d_l_e _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              This  command  changes  the current working directory on the ftp
              server to a specified target _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.  The command  returns  1
              if the current working directory was successfully changed to the
              specified directory or 0 if it fails.  The target directory  can
              be

              +o      a subdirectory of the current directory,

              +o      Two  dots,  ....  (as an indicator for the parent directory
                     of the current directory)

              +o      or a fully qualified path to a new working directory.

       ::::ffttpp::::PPwwdd _h_a_n_d_l_e
              This command returns the complete path of  the  current  working
              directory  on  the  ftp server, or an empty string in case of an
              error.

       ::::ffttpp::::TTyyppee _h_a_n_d_l_e ?aasscciiii||bbiinnaarryy||tteenneexx?
              This command sets the ftp file transfer type  to  either  aasscciiii,
              bbiinnaarryy,  or  tteenneexx. The command always returns the currently set
              type. If called without type no change is made.

              Currently only aasscciiii and bbiinnaarryy types are  supported.  There  is
              some  early  (alpha)  support  for Tenex mode. The type aasscciiii is
              normally used to convert text files into a format  suitable  for
              text  editors  on  the platform of the destination machine. This
              mainly affects end-of-line markers. The type bbiinnaarryy on the other
              hand  allows the undisturbed transfer of non-text files, such as
              compressed files, images and executables.

       ::::ffttpp::::LLiisstt _h_a_n_d_l_e ?_p_a_t_t_e_r_n?
              This command returns a human-readable list of  files.   Wildcard
              expressions such as ""_*_._t_c_l"" are allowed.  If _p_a_t_t_e_r_n refers to a
              specific directory, then the  contents  of  that  directory  are
              returned.   If  the  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n is not a fully-qualified path name,
              the command lists entries relative to the current remote  direc-
              tory.   If  no _p_a_t_t_e_r_n is specified, the contents of the current
              remote directory is returned.

              The listing includes any system-dependent information  that  the
              server chooses to include. For example most UNIX systems produce
              output from the command llss --ll. The command returns the retrieved
              information  as  a tcl list with one item per entry. Empty lines
              and UNIX's ""total"" lines are ignored and  not  included  in  the
              result as reported by this command.

              If the command fails an empty list is returned.

       ::::ffttpp::::NNLLiisstt _h_a_n_d_l_e ?_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y?
              This  command  has the same behavior as the ::::ffttpp::::LLiisstt command,
              except that it only retrieves an abbreviated listing. This means
              only file names are returned in a sorted list.

       ::::ffttpp::::FFiilleeSSiizzee _h_a_n_d_l_e _f_i_l_e
              This  command  returns the size of the specified _f_i_l_e on the ftp
              server. If the command fails an empty string is returned.

              _A_T_T_E_N_T_I_O_N_! It will not work properly when in ascii mode  and  is
              not supported by all ftp server implementations.

              This  command retrieves the time of the last modification of the
              _f_i_l_e on the ftp server as a system dependent  integer  value  in
              seconds  or an empty string if an error occurred. Use the built-
              in command cclloocckk to convert the retrieves value into other  for-
              mats.

       ::::ffttpp::::DDeelleettee _h_a_n_d_l_e _f_i_l_e
              This  command  deletes the specified _f_i_l_e on the ftp server. The
              command returns 1 if the specified file was successfully deleted
              or 0 if it failed.

       ::::ffttpp::::RReennaammee _h_a_n_d_l_e _f_r_o_m _t_o
              This  command  renames the file _f_r_o_m in the current directory of
              the ftp server to the specified new file name _t_o. This new  file
              name  must  not be the same as any existing subdirectory or file
              name.  The command returns 1 if the specified file was  success-
              fully renamed or 0 if it failed.

              This  command  transfers  a  local  file  _l_o_c_a_l to a remote file
              _r_e_m_o_t_e on the ftp server. If the file parameters passed  to  the
              command  do  not fully qualified path names the command will use
              the current directory on local and remote host.  If  the  remote
              file  name  is  unspecified, the server will use the name of the
              local file as the name of the remote file. The command returns 1
              to  indicate  a successful transfer and 0 in the case of a fail-
              ure.

              If --ddaattaa _d_a_t_a is specified instead of a local file,  the  system
              will  not  transfer a file, but the _d_a_t_a passed into it. In this
              case the name of the remote file has to be specified.

              If --cchhaannnneell _c_h_a_n is specified instead of a local file, the  sys-
              tem will not transfer a file, but read the contents of the chan-
              nel _c_h_a_n and write this to the remote file.  In  this  case  the
              name  of the remote file has to be specified. After the transfer
              _c_h_a_n will be closed.

       ::::ffttpp::::AAppppeenndd _h_a_n_d_l_e (_l_o_c_a_l | -data _d_a_t_a | -channel _c_h_a_n) ?_r_e_m_o_t_e?
              This command behaves like ::::ffttpp::::PPuuttss, but  appends  the  trans-
              fered  information to the remote file. If the file did not exist
              on the server it will be created.

       ::::ffttpp::::GGeett _h_a_n_d_l_e _r_e_m_o_t_e ?(_l_o_c_a_l | -variable _v_a_r_n_a_m_e | -channel  _c_h_a_n)?
              This command retrieves a remote file _r_e_m_o_t_e on  the  ftp  server
              and  stores  its contents into the local file _l_o_c_a_l. If the file
              parameters passed to the command are not  fully  qualified  path
              names  the  command  will use the current directory on local and
              remote host. If the local file name is unspecified,  the  server
              will  use  the  name of the remote file as the name of the local
              file. The command returns 1 to indicate  a  successful  transfer
              and  0 in the case of a failure. The command will throw an error
              if the directory the file _l_o_c_a_l is to  be  placed  in  does  not
              exist.

              If  --vvaarriiaabbllee  _v_a_r_n_a_m_e  is  specified, the system will store the
              retrieved data into the variable _v_a_r_n_a_m_e instead of a file.

              If --cchhaannnneell  _c_h_a_n  is  specified,  the  system  will  write  the
              retrieved data into the channel _c_h_a_n instead of a file. The sys-
              tem will _n_o_t close _c_h_a_n after the transfer, this is the  respon-
              sibility of the caller to ::::ffttpp::::GGeett.

       ::::ffttpp::::RReeggeett _h_a_n_d_l_e _r_e_m_o_t_e ?_l_o_c_a_l? ?_f_r_o_m? ?_t_o?
              This  command behaves like ::::ffttpp::::GGeett, except that if local file
              _l_o_c_a_l exists and is smaller than remote file _r_e_m_o_t_e,  the  local
              file  is  presumed  to  be  a  partially transferred copy of the
              remote file and the transfer  is  continued  from  the  apparent
              point of failure.  The command will throw an error if the direc-
              tory the file _l_o_c_a_l is to be placed in does not exist. This com-
              mand  is useful when transferring very large files over networks
              that tend to drop connections.

              Specifying the additional byte offsets _f_r_o_m and  _t_o  will  cause
              the  command to change its behaviour and to download exactly the
              specified slice of the remote file. This mode is  possible  only
              if  a  local  destination is explicitly provided. Omission of _t_o
              leads to downloading till the end of the file.

       ::::ffttpp::::NNeewweerr _h_a_n_d_l_e _r_e_m_o_t_e ?_l_o_c_a_l?
              This command behaves like ::::ffttpp::::GGeett, except that  it  retrieves
              the remote file only if the modification time of the remote file
              is more recent than the file on the local system.  If  the  file
              does  not  exist on the local system, the remote file is consid-
              ered newer. The command will throw an error if the directory the
              file _l_o_c_a_l is to be placed in does not exist.

       ::::ffttpp::::MMkkDDiirr _h_a_n_d_l_e _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              This  command creates the specified _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y on the ftp server.
              If the specified path is relative the new directory will be cre-
              ated  as  a  subdirectory of the current working directory. Else
              the created directory will have the  specified  path  name.  The
              command  returns  1  to  indicate  a  successful creation of the
              directory and 0 in the case of a failure.

              This command removes the specified directory on the ftp  server.
              The  remote  directory has to be empty or the command will fail.
              The command returns 1 to indicate a successful  removal  of  the
              directory and 0 in the case of a failure.

              This  command  is  used  to send an arbitrary ftp command to the
              server. It cannot be used to obtain a directory listing  or  for
              transferring  files.  It  is included to allow an application to
              execute commands on the ftp server which  are  not  provided  by
              this package.  The arguments are sent verbatim, i.e. as is, with
              no changes.

              In contrast to the other commands in this package  this  command
              will  not  parse  the  response  it  got from the ftp server but
              return it verbatim to the caller.

              This command is used by the package itself to show the different
              messages from the ftp sessions. The package itself declares this
              command  very  simple,  writing  the  messages  to  ssttddoouutt   (if
              ::::ffttpp::::VVEERRBBOOSSEE  was  set, see below) and throwing tcl errors for
              error messages. It is the responsibility of the  application  to
              overwrite  it  as  needed. A state variable for different states
              assigned to different colors is recommended by the  author.  The
              package lloogg is useful for this.

       ::::ffttpp::::VVEERRBBOOSSEE
              A  state variable controlling the output of the package. Setting
              ::::ffttpp::::VVEERRBBOOSSEE to ""1"" forces the package to show  all  responses
              from a remote server. The default value is ""0"".

       ::::ffttpp::::DDEEBBUUGG
              A   state  variable  controlling  the  output  of  ftp.  Setting
              ::::ffttpp::::DDEEBBUUGG to ""1"" enables debugging and forces the package  to
              show all return codes, states, state changes and ""real"" ftp com-
              mands. The default value is ""0"".


BBUUGGSS
       The correct execution of many commands depends upon the proper behavior
       by the remote server, network and router configuration.

       An  update  command  placed  in the procedure ::::ffttpp::::DDiissppllaayyMMssgg may run
       into persistent errors or infinite loops. The solution to this  problem
       is to use uuppddaattee iiddlleettaasskkss instead of uuppddaattee.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ffiinnggeerr utility displays information about the system users.

     Options are:

     --44      Forces ffiinnggeerr to use IPv4 addresses only.

     --66      Forces ffiinnggeerr to use IPv6 addresses only.

     --gg      This option restricts the gecos output to only the users' real
             name.  It also has the side-effect of restricting the output of
             the remote host when used in conjunction with the --hh option.

     --hh      When used in conjunction with the --ss option, the name of the
             remote host is displayed instead of the office location and
             office phone.

     --kk      Disable all use of utmpx(5).

     --ll      Produce a multi-line format displaying all of the information
             described for the --ss option as well as the user's home directory,
             home phone number, login shell, mail status, and the contents of
             the files _._f_o_r_w_a_r_d, _._p_l_a_n, _._p_r_o_j_e_c_t and _._p_u_b_k_e_y from the user's
             home directory.

             If idle time is at least a minute and less than a day, it is pre-
             sented in the form ``hh:mm''.  Idle times greater than a day are
             presented as ``d day[s]hh:mm''.

             Phone numbers specified as eleven digits are printed as ``+N-NNN-
             NNN-NNNN''.  Numbers specified as ten or seven digits are printed
             as the appropriate subset of that string.  Numbers specified as
             five digits are printed as ``xN-NNNN''.  Numbers specified as
             four digits are printed as ``xNNNN''.

             If write permission is denied to the device, the phrase ``(mes-
             sages off)'' is appended to the line containing the device name.
             One entry per user is displayed with the --ll option; if a user is
             logged on multiple times, terminal information is repeated once
             per login.

             Mail status is shown as ``No Mail.'' if there is no mail at all,
             ``Mail last read DDD MMM ## HH:MM YYYY (TZ)'' if the person has
             looked at their mailbox since new mail arriving, or ``New mail
             received ...'', ``Unread since ...'' if they have new mail.

     --mm      Prevent matching of _u_s_e_r names.  _U_s_e_r is usually a login name;
             however, matching will also be done on the users' real names,
             unless the --mm option is supplied.  All name matching performed by
             ffiinnggeerr is case insensitive.

     --oo      When used in conjunction with the --ss option, the office location
             and office phone information is displayed instead of the name of
             the remote host.

     --pp      Prevent the --ll option of ffiinnggeerr from displaying the contents of
             the _._f_o_r_w_a_r_d, _._p_l_a_n, _._p_r_o_j_e_c_t and _._p_u_b_k_e_y files.

     --ss      Display the user's login name, real name, terminal name and write
             status (as a ``*'' before the terminal name if write permission
             is denied), idle time, login time, and either office location and
             office phone number, or the remote host.  If --oo is given, the
             office location and office phone number is printed (the default).
             If --hh is given, the remote host is printed instead.

             Idle time is in minutes if it is a single integer, hours and min-
             utes if a ``:'' is present, or days if a ``d'' is present.  If it
             is an ``*'', the login time indicates the time of last login.
             Login time is displayed as the day name if less than 6 days, else
             month, day; hours and minutes, unless more than six months ago,
             in which case the year is displayed rather than the hours and
             minutes.

             Unknown devices as well as nonexistent idle and login times are
             displayed as single asterisks.

     If no options are specified, ffiinnggeerr defaults to the --ll style output if
     operands are provided, otherwise to the --ss style.  Note that some fields
     may be missing, in either format, if information is not available for
     them.

     If no arguments are specified, ffiinnggeerr will print an entry for each user
     currently logged into the system.

     The ffiinnggeerr utility may be used to look up users on a remote machine.  The
     format is to specify a _u_s_e_r as ``user@host'', or ``@host'', where the
     default output format for the former is the --ll style, and the default
     output format for the latter is the --ss style.  The --ll option is the only
     option that may be passed to a remote machine.

     If the file _._n_o_f_i_n_g_e_r exists in the user's home directory, and the pro-
     gram is not run with superuser privileges, ffiinnggeerr behaves as if the user
     in question does not exist.

     The optional finger.conf(5) configuration file can be used to specify
     aliases.  Since ffiinnggeerr is invoked by fingerd(8), aliases will work for
     both local and network queries.

     The ffiinnggeerr command appeared in 3.0BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     The current FINGER protocol RFC requires that the client keep the connec-
     tion fully open until the server closes.  This prevents the use of the
     optimal three-packet T/TCP exchange.  (Servers which depend on this
     requirement are bogus but have nonetheless been observed in the Internet
     at large.)

     The ffiinnggeerr utility does not recognize multibyte characters.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

     rrppcciinnffoo makes an RPC call to an RPC server and reports what it finds.
     Unless otherwise specified or noted below the default rrppccbbiinndd protocol
     version is 3.  With no or only generic options, call the rrppccbbiinndd dump
     procedure on the specified _h_o_s_t or ``localhost'' if _h_o_s_t is not specified
     and display the results.  For versions 3 and 4 display the program num-
     ber, the version, the ``netid'', the universal address that the services
     is listening on, symbolic name of the program if known, and then the
     owner that registered the <program, version, netid, address> tuple.  For
     version 2 of the protocol list the program, version, protocol, port, and
     symbolic program name.  _S_e_e _t_h_e ----ssuummmmaarryy _o_p_t_i_o_n _b_e_l_o_w _f_o_r _a _t_y_p_i_c_a_l_l_y
     _m_o_r_e _u_s_e_f_u_l _o_u_t_p_u_t_. rrppccbbiinndd defaults the _n_e_t_i_d to ``tcp'' for the dump
     procedure.

     The _p_r_o_g_r_a_m argument can be either a name or a number.

     If a version is specified, rpcinfo attempts to call that version of the
     specified program.  Otherwise, if the version is optional rrppcciinnffoo
     attempts to find all the registered version numbers for the specified
     program by calling version 0 (which is presumed not to exist; if it does
     exist, rpcinfo attempts to obtain this information by calling an
     extremely high version number instead) and attempts to call each regis-
     tered version.

     A required transport option is needed for the second and third lines of
     the synopsis which is used to ping, i.e., call the null procedure of the
     specified program and version. The results will be displayed on stdout.
     If version is not specified each valid version found as described above
     will be called.  The third synopsis will use the supplied universal
     address over the transport specified by _n_e_t_i_d to call the null procedure
     of the specified _p_r_o_g_r_a_m in the same manner as above. In addition the
     last two lines of the synopsis can ``ping'' the server as described in
     the LLeeggaaccyy OOppttiioonnss section below.

             of the specified _p_r_o_g_r_a_m and _v_e_r_s_i_o_n and report all hosts that
             respond.  rrppcciiffnnoo will first use RPCBIND version 3 and then call
             the broadcast procedure of the ppoorrttmmaappppeerr protocol to collect
             older hosts. There is a reply cache kept so duplicates will not
             be returned unless the cache fills.

             Note that the --bb option by its self is compatible with the older
             ppoorrttmmaappppeerr.  However, specifying ----rrppccbbvveerrss 2 will short circuit
             the rrppccbbiinndd version 3 calls and only call the ppoorrttmmaappppeerr.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The mmoouunntt command calls the mount(2) system call to prepare and graft a
     _s_p_e_c_i_a_l _d_e_v_i_c_e or the remote node (rhost:path) on to the file system tree
     at the point _m_o_u_n_t___p_o_i_n_t, which must be a directory.  If either _s_p_e_c_i_a_l
     or _m_o_u_n_t___p_o_i_n_t are not provided, the appropriate information is obtained
     via the getfsent(3) library routines.

     The system maintains a list of currently mounted file systems.  If no
     arguments are given to mmoouunntt,, this list is printed.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa      All the filesystems listed via getfsent(3) are mounted.  Excep-
             tions are those marked as ``noauto;'' excluded by the --tt flag
             (see below); entries that are neither ``ro,'' ``rw,'' or ``rq;''
             ``nfs'' entries that also have ``net'' as an option; and already-
             mounted ``nfs'' entries.

     --dd      Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call.
             This option is useful in conjunction with the --vv flag to deter-
             mine what the mmoouunntt command is trying to do.

     --ff      Forces the revocation of write access when trying to downgrade a
             filesystem mount status from read-write to read-only.

     --oo      Options are specified with a --oo flag followed by a comma sepa-
             rated string of options.  The following options are available:

             async   All I/O to the file system should be done asynchronously.
                     This can be somewhat dangerous with respect to losing
                     data when faced with system crashes and power outages.
                     This is also the default.  It can be avoided with the
                     _n_o_a_s_y_n_c option.

             force   The same as --ff; forces the revocation of write access
                     when trying to downgrade a filesystem mount status from
                     read-write to read-only.

             noasync
                     This filesystem should not force all I/O to be written
                     asynchronously.

             noauto  This filesystem should be skipped when mount is run with
                     the --aa flag.

             nodev   Do not interpret character or block special devices on
                     the file system.  This option is useful for a server that
                     has file systems containing special devices for architec-
                     tures other than its own.

             noexec  Do not allow execution of any binaries on the mounted
                     file system.  This option is useful for a server that has
                     file systems containing binaries for architectures other
                     than its own.

             noowners
                     Ignore the ownership field for the entire volume.  This
                     causes all objects to appear as owned by user ID 99 and
                     group ID 99.  User ID 99 is interpreted as the current
                     effective user ID, while group ID 99 is used directly and
                     translates to ``unknown''.

             nosuid  Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier
                     bits to take effect.

             rdonly  The same as --rr; mount the file system read-only (even the
                     super-user may not write it).

             sync    All I/O to the file system should be done synchronously.

             update  The same as --uu; indicate that the status of an already
                     mounted file system should be changed.

             union   Causes the namespace to appear as the union of directo-
                     ries of the mounted filesystem with corresponding direc-
                     tories in the underlying filesystem.  Lookups will be
                     done in the mounted filesystem first.  If those opera-
                     tions fail due to a non-existent file the underlying
                     directory is then accessed.

             noatime
                     Do not update the file access time when reading from a
                     file.  This option is useful on file systems where there
                     are large numbers of files and performance is more criti-
                     cal than updating the file access time (which is rarely
                     ever important).

             nobrowse
                     This option indicates that the mount point should not be
                     visible via the GUI (i.e., appear on the Desktop as a
                     separate volume).

             Any additional options specific to a filesystem type that is not
             one of the internally known types (see the --tt option) may be
             passed as a comma separated list; these options are distinguished
             by a leading ``-'' (dash).  Options that take a value are speci-
             fied using the syntax -option=value.  For example, the mount com-
             mand:

                   mount -t hfs -o nosuid,-w,-m=755 /dev/disk2s9 /tmp

             causes mmoouunntt to execute the equivalent of:

                   /sbin/mount_hfs -o nosuid -w -m 755 /dev/disk2s9 /tmp

     --rr      Mount the file system read-only (even the super-user may not
             write it).  The same as the ``rdonly'' argument to the --oo option.

     --tt _l_f_s | _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l _t_y_p_e
             The argument following the --tt is used to indicate the file system
             type.  There is no default local file system for use with mount.
             A type must be specified in order to mount a non-NFS filesystem.
             The _-_t option can be used to indicate that the actions should
             only be taken on filesystems of the specified type.  More than
             one type may be specified in a comma separated list.  The list of
             filesystem types can be prefixed with ``no'' to specify the
             filesystem types for which action should _n_o_t be taken.  For exam-
             ple, the mmoouunntt command:

                   mount -a -t nonfs,hfs

             mounts all filesystems except those of type NFS and HFS.

             If the type is not one of the internally known types, mount will
             attempt to execute a program in _/_s_b_i_n_/_m_o_u_n_t___X_X_X where _X_X_X is
             replaced by the type name.  For example, nfs filesystems are
             mounted by the program _/_s_b_i_n_/_m_o_u_n_t___n_f_s.

     --uu      The --uu flag indicates that the status of an already mounted file
             system should be changed.  Any of the options discussed above
             (the --oo option) may be changed; also a file system can be changed
             from read-only to read-write or vice versa.  An attempt to change
             from read-write to read-only will fail if any files on the
             filesystem are currently open for writing unless the --ff flag is
             also specified.  The set of options is determined by first
             extracting the options for the file system from the filesystem
             table (see getfsent(3)) then applying any options specified by
             the --oo argument, and finally applying the --rr or --ww option.

     --vv      Verbose mode.

     --ww      Mount the file system read-write.

             The options specific to NFS filesystems are described in the
             mount_nfs(8) manual page.

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

       This  command  performs  variable substitutions, command substitutions,
       and backslash substitutions on its  _s_t_r_i_n_g  argument  and  returns  the
       fully-substituted  result.   The substitutions are performed in exactly
       the same way as for Tcl commands.  As a result, the _s_t_r_i_n_g argument  is
       actually substituted twice, once by the Tcl parser in the usual fashion
       for Tcl commands, and again by the _s_u_b_s_t command.

       If any of the --nnoobbaacckkssllaasshheess, --nnooccoommmmaannddss, or --nnoovvaarriiaabblleess  are  speci-
       fied,  then  the  corresponding  substitutions  are not performed.  For
       example, if --nnooccoommmmaannddss is specified, command substitution is not  per-
       formed:   open  and  close  brackets are treated as ordinary characters
       with no special interpretation.

       Note that the substitution of one  kind  can  include  substitution  of
       other  kinds.  For example, even when the --nnoovvaarriiaabblleess option is speci-
       fied, command substitution  is  performed  without  restriction.   This
       means  that any variable substitution necessary to complete the command
       substitution will still take place.  Likewise, any command substitution
       necessary  to  complete  a  variable substitution will take place, even
       when --nnooccoommmmaannddss is specified.  See the EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS below.

       If an error occurs during substitution, then  ssuubbsstt  will  return  that
       error.   If a break exception occurs during command or variable substi-
       tution, the result of the whole substitution will  be  the  string  (as
       substituted) up to the start of the substitution that raised the excep-
       tion.  If a continue exception occurs during the evaluation of  a  com-
       mand  or variable substitution, an empty string will be substituted for
       that entire command or variable substitution (as long as  it  is  well-
       formed Tcl.)  If a return exception occurs, or any other return code is
       returned during command or variable  substitution,  then  the  returned
       value  is  substituted  for that substitution.  See the EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS below.
       In this way, all exceptional return codes are ""caught"" by  ssuubbsstt.   The
       ssuubbsstt command itself will either return an error, or will complete suc-
       cessfully.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       When it performs its substitutions, _s_u_b_s_t does  not  give  any  special
       treatment  to double quotes or curly braces (except within command sub-
       stitutions) so the script
              set a 44
              ssuubbsstt {xyz {$a}}
       returns ""xxyyzz {{4444}}"", not ""xxyyzz {{$$aa}}"" and the script
              set a ""p\} q \{r""
              ssuubbsstt {xyz {$a}}
       returns ""xxyyzz {{pp}} qq {{rr}}"", not ""xxyyzz {{pp\\}} qq \\{{rr}}"".

       When command substitution is performed, it includes any  variable  sub-
       stitution necessary to evaluate the script.
              set a 44
              ssuubbsstt -novariables {$a [format $a]}
       returns ""$$aa 4444"", not ""$$aa $$aa"".  Similarly, when variable substitution is
       performed, it includes any command substitution necessary  to  retrieve
       the value of the variable.
              proc b {} {return c}
              array set a {c c [b] tricky}
              ssuubbsstt -nocommands {[b] $a([b])}
       returns ""[[bb]] cc"", not ""[[bb]] ttrriicckkyy"".

       The  continue  and break exceptions allow command substitutions to pre-
       vent substitution of the rest of the command substitution and the  rest
       of  _s_t_r_i_n_g  respectively,  giving script authors more options when pro-
       cessing text using _s_u_b_s_t.  For example, the script
              ssuubbsstt {abc,[break],def}
       returns ""aabbcc,,"", not ""aabbcc,,,,ddeeff"" and the script
              ssuubbsstt {abc,[continue;expr {1+2}],def}
       returns ""aabbcc,,,,ddeeff"", not ""aabbcc,,33,,ddeeff"".

       Other exceptional return codes substitute the returned value
              ssuubbsstt {abc,[return foo;expr {1+2}],def}
       returns ""aabbcc,,ffoooo,,ddeeff"", not ""aabbcc,,33,,ddeeff"" and
              ssuubbsstt {abc,[return -code 10 foo;expr {1+2}],def}
       also returns ""aabbcc,,ffoooo,,ddeeff"", not ""aabbcc,,33,,ddeeff"".

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

     Directories provide a convenient hierarchical method of grouping files
     while obscuring the underlying details of the storage medium.  A direc-
     tory file is differentiated from a plain file by a flag in its inode(5)
     entry.  It consists of records (directory entries) each of which contains
     information about a file and a pointer to the file itself.  Directory
     entries may contain other directories as well as plain files; such nested
     directories are refered to as subdirectories.  A hierarchy of directories
     and files is formed in this manner and is called a file system (or
     referred to as a file system tree).

     Each directory file contains two special directory entries; one is a
     pointer to the directory itself called dot `.' and the other a pointer to
     its parent directory called dot-dot `..'.  Dot and dot-dot are valid
     pathnames, however, the system root directory `/', has no parent and dot-
     dot points to itself like dot.

     File system nodes are ordinary directory files on which has been grafted
     a file system object, such as a physical disk or a partitioned area of
     such a disk.  (See mount(1) and mount(8).)

     The directory entry format is defined in the file <sys/dirent.h> and fur-
     ther in the file <dirent.h>.  When the macro _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_BIT_INODE
     is not defined (see stat(2) for more information on this macro), the
     _d_i_r_e_n_t structure is defined as:

     /*** Excerpt from <sys/dirent.h> ***/
     /*
      * The dirent structure defines the format of directory entries.
      *
      * A directory entry has a struct dirent at the front of it, containing its
      * inode number, the length of the entry, and the length of the name
      * contained in the entry.  These are followed by the name padded to a 4
      * byte boundary with null bytes.  All names are guaranteed null terminated.
      * The maximum length of a name in a directory is 255.
      */

     struct dirent { /* when _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_BIT_INODE is NOT defined */
             ino_t      d_ino;                /* file number of entry */
             __uint16_t d_reclen;             /* length of this record */
             __uint8_t  d_type;               /* file type, see below */
             __uint8_t  d_namlen;             /* length of string in d_name */
             char    d_name[255 + 1];   /* name must be no longer than this */
     };

     However, when the macro _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_BIT_INODE is defined, the
     _d_i_r_e_n_t structure is defined as:

     /*
      * The dirent structure defines the format of directory entries.
      *
      * A directory entry has a struct dirent at the front of it, containing its
      * inode number, the length of the entry, and the length of the name
      * contained in the entry.  These are followed by the name padded to a 4
      * byte boundary with null bytes.  All names are guaranteed null terminated.
      * The maximum length of a name in a directory is 1023.
      */

     struct dirent { /* when _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_BIT_INODE is defined */
             ino_t      d_fileno;     /* file number of entry */
             __uint64_t d_seekoff;    /* seek offset (optional, used by servers) */

     The uunniittss program converts quantities expressed in various scales to
     their equivalents in other scales.  The uunniittss program can only handle
     multiplicative scale changes.  It cannot convert Celsius to Fahrenheit,
     for example.  It works interactively by prompting the user for input:

         You have: meters
         You want: feet
                 * 3.2808399
                 / 0.3048

         You have: cm^3
         You want: gallons
                 * 0.00026417205
                 / 3785.4118

         You have: meters/s
         You want: furlongs/fortnight
                 * 6012.8848
                 / 0.00016630952

         You have: 1|2 inch
         You want: cm
                 * 1.27
                 / 0.78740157

     Powers of units can be specified using the '^' character as shown in the
     example, or by simple concatenation: 'cm3' is equivalent to 'cm^3'.  Mul-
     tiplication of units can be specified by using spaces, a dash or an
     asterisk.  Division of units is indicated by the slash ('/').  Note that
     multiplication has a higher precedence than division, so 'm/s/s' is the
     same as 'm/s^2' or 'm/s s'.  Division of numbers must be indicated using
     the vertical bar ('|').  To convert half a meter, you would write '1|2
     meter'.  If you write '1/2 meter' then the units program would interpret
     that as equivalent to '0.5/meter'.  If you enter incompatible unit types,
     the units program will print a message indicating that the units are not
     conformable and it will display the reduced form for each unit:

         You have: ergs/hour
         You want: fathoms kg^2 / day
         conformability error
                 2.7777778e-11 kg m^2 / sec^3
                 2.1166667e-05 kg^2 m / sec

     The conversion information is read from a units data file.  The default
     file includes definitions for most familiar units, abbreviations and met-
     ric prefixes.  Some constants of nature included are:

           pi         ratio of circumference to diameter
           c          speed of light
           e          charge on an electron
           g          acceleration of gravity
           force      same as g
           mole       Avogadro's number
           water      pressure per unit height of water
           mercury    pressure per unit height of mercury
           au         astronomical unit

     The unit 'pound' is a unit of mass.  Compound names are run together so
     'pound force' is a unit of force.  The unit 'ounce' is also a unit of
     mass.  The fluid ounce is 'floz'.  British units that differ from their
     US counterparts are prefixed with 'br', and currency is prefixed with its
     country name: 'belgiumfranc', 'britainpound'.  When searching for a unit,
     if the specified string does not appear exactly as a unit name, then
     uunniittss will try to remove a trailing 's' or a trailing 'es' and check
     again for a match.

     To find out what units are available read the standard units file.  If
     you want to add your own units you can supply your own file.  A unit is
     specified on a single line by giving its name and an equivalence.  Be
     careful to define new units in terms of old ones so that a reduction
     leads to the primitive units which are marked with '!' characters.  The
     uunniittss program will not detect infinite loops that could be caused by
     careless unit definitions.  Comments in the unit definition file begin
     with a '/' character at the beginning of a line.

     Prefixes are defined in the same was as standard units, but with a trail-
     ing dash at the end of the prefix name.  If a unit is not found even
     after removing trailing 's' or 'es', then it will be checked against the
     list of prefixes.  Prefixes will be removed until a legal base unit is
     identified.

     Here is an example of a short units file that defines some basic units.

           m         !a!
           sec       !b!

     The effect of including a '/' in a prefix is surprising.

     Exponents entered by the user can be only one digit.  You can work around
     this by multiplying several terms.

     The user must use | to indicate division of numbers and / to indicate
     division of symbols.  This distinction should not be necessary.

     The program contains various arbitrary limits on the length of the units
     converted and on the length of the data file.

     The program should use a hash table to store units so that it does not
     take so long to load the units list and check for duplication.

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _T_r_e_e  is  a  recursive  directory listing program that produces a depth
       indented listing of files, which is  colorized  ala  _d_i_r_c_o_l_o_r_s  if  the
       LLSS__CCOOLLOORRSS  environment  variable  is set and output is to tty.  With no
       arguments, _t_r_e_e lists the files in the current directory.  When  direc-
       tory  arguments  are given, _t_r_e_e lists all the files and/or directories
       found in the given directories each in turn.  Upon completion of  list-
       ing all files/directories found, _t_r_e_e returns the total number of files
       and/or directories listed.

       By default, when a symbolic link is encountered, the path that the sym-
       bolic  link refers to is printed after the name of the link in the for-
       mat:

           name -> real-path

       If the `--ll' option is given and the symbolic link refers to  an  actual
       directory, then _t_r_e_e will follow the path of the symbolic link as if it
       were a real directory.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _T_r_e_e understands the following command line switches:


LLIISSTTIINNGG OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aa     All files are printed.  By default tree does  not  print  hidden
              files  (those  beginning with a dot `.').  In no event does tree

              sites.   _b_a_s_e_H_R_E_F  gives  the  base ftp location when using HTML
              output. That is, the local directory  may  be  `/local/ftp/pub',
              but   it   must   be   referenced  as  `ftp://hostname.organiza-
              tion.domain/pub' (_b_a_s_e_H_R_E_F should  be  `ftp://hostname.organiza-

              don't give more than one directory in the directory list. If you
              wish  to  use  colors  via CSS style-sheet, use the -C option in

       Tree does not prune ""empty"" directories when the -P and -I options  are
       used by default. Use the --prune option.

       The -h and --si options round to the nearest whole number unlike the ls
       implementations which rounds up always.

       Pruning files and directories with the -I, -P and  --filelimit  options
       will lead to incorrect file/directory count reports.

       The  --prune  and --du options cause tree to accumulate the entire tree
       in memory before emitting it. For large directory trees this can  cause
       a significant delay in output and the use of large amounts of memory.

       The  timefmt  expansion  buffer  is limited to a ridiculously large 255
       characters.  Output of time strings longer than this will be undefined,
       but are guaranteed to not exceed 255 characters.

       XML/JSON trees are not colored, which is a bit of a shame.

       Probably more.

     Arguments are processed in the order given.  In order to remove both a

             but waits before removing power for 5 minutes so that an external
             UPS (uninterruptible power supply) can forcibly remove power.
             This simulates a dirty shutdown to permit a later automatic power
             on. OS X uses this mode automatically with supported UPSs in
             emergency shutdowns.

     _t_i_m_e    _T_i_m_e is the time at which sshhuuttddoowwnn will bring the system down and
             may be the word _n_o_w (indicating an immediate shutdown) or specify
             a future time in one of two formats: _+_n_u_m_b_e_r, or _y_y_m_m_d_d_h_h_m_m,
             where the year, month, and day may be defaulted to the current
             system values.  The first form brings the system down in _n_u_m_b_e_r
             minutes and the second at the absolute time specified.

     _w_a_r_n_i_n_g_-_m_e_s_s_a_g_e
             Any other arguments comprise the warning message that is broad-
             cast to users currently logged into the system.

     --       If `--' is supplied as an option, the warning message is read from
             the standard input.

     At intervals, becoming more frequent as apocalypse approaches and start-
     ing at ten hours before shutdown, warning messages are displayed on the
     terminals of all users logged in.

     At shutdown time a message is written to the system log, containing the
     time of shutdown, the person who initiated the shutdown and the reason.
     Corresponding signal is then sent to launchd(8) to respectively halt,
     reboot or bring the system down to single-user state (depending on the
     above options).

     A scheduled shutdown can be canceled by killing the sshhuuttddoowwnn process (a
     SIGTERM should suffice).

     Upon shutdown, all running processes are sent a SIGTERM followed by a
     SIGKILL.  The SIGKILL will follow the SIGTERM by an intentionally inde-
     terminate period of time.  Programs are expected to take only enough time
     to flush all dirty data and exit.  Developers are encouraged to file a
     bug with the OS vendor, should they encounter an issue with this func-
     tionality.

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

     Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the run-
     ning shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands,
     the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a
     pipeline except the last.

     If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell
     will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the
     specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while
     specifying ``eecchhoo'' causes a builtin command to be executed under shells
     that support the eecchhoo builtin command, specifying ``//bbiinn//eecchhoo'' or
     ``..//eecchhoo'' does not.

     While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their oper-
     ation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a
     table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that sup-
     port them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

     Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.
     Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin
     commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of
     these commands ``built-in commands'' and some of them ``reserved words''.
     Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other
     sources of documentation.

     Commands marked ``No**'' under _E_x_t_e_r_n_a_l do exist externally, but are
     implemented as scripts using a builtin command of the same name.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     iippccoonnffiigg is a utility that communicates with the IPConfiguration agent to
     retrieve and set IP configuration parameters.  It should only be used in
     a test and debug context.  Using it for any other purpose is strongly
     discouraged.  Public API's in the SystemConfiguration framework are cur-
     rently the only supported way to access and control the state of IPCon-
     figuration.

     The IPConfiguration agent is responsible for configuring and managing the
     IP addresses on direct, connectionless interfaces such as IEEE 802.3 Eth-
     ernet and IEEE 1394 FireWire.  The IPConfiguration agent is a program
     bundle that is loaded and executed by the configd(8) process.

     The IPConfiguration agent implements the client side of the DHCP and
     BOOTP protocols described in RFC951, RFC1542, RFC2131, and RFC2132.  It
     also assigns and maintains static IP addresses.  It may also allocate and
     assign a link-local IP address if DHCP fails to acquire an IP address.

     In all cases, the IPConfiguration agent performs IP address conflict
     detection before assigning an IP address to an interface.

CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
     The iippccoonnffiigg utility provides several commands:

     wwaaiittaallll     Blocks until all network services have completed configuring,
                 or have timed out in the process of configuring.  This is
                 only useful for initial system start-up time synchronization
                 for legacy network services that are incapable of dealing
                 with dynamic network configuration changes.

     ggeettiiffaaddddrr _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e_-_n_a_m_e
                 Prints to standard output the IP address for the first net-
                 work service associated with the given interface.  The output
                 will be empty if no service is currently configured or active
                 on the interface.

     iiffccoouunntt     Prints the number of interfaces that IPConfiguration is capa-
                 ble of configuring.  The value that's printed will not change
                 unless relevant network interfaces are either added to or
                 removed from the system.

     ggeettooppttiioonn _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e_-_n_a_m_e (_o_p_t_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e | _o_p_t_i_o_n_-_c_o_d_e)
                 Prints the BOOTP/DHCP option with the given name or option
                 code integer value.  See bootpd(8) for option code names.  If
                 an option has multiple values e.g. ddoommaaiinn__nnaammee__sseerrvveerr, only
                 the first value is printed.

                 Prints to standard output the DHCP/BOOTP packet that the
                 client accepted from the DHCP/BOOTP server.  This command is
                 useful to check what the server provided, and whether the
                 values are sensible.  This command outputs nothing if
                 DHCP/BOOTP is not active on the interface, or the attempt to
                 acquire an IP address was unsuccessful.

                 Prints to standard output the latest DHCPv6 packet that the
                 client accepted from the DHCPv6 server.  In the case of
                 stateful DHCPv6, it corresponds to the last packet from the
                 server that contained addressing information.  This command
                 is useful to check what the server provided, and whether the
                 values are sensible.  This command outputs nothing if DHCPv6
                 is not active on the interface.

                 Sets the interface to have a new temporary network service of
                 the given type.  Any existing services on the interface for
                 the particular protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) are first de-config-
                 ured before the new service is instantiated.

                 If NONE is specified, all existing IPv4 services are de-con-
                 figured.  If NONE-V6 is specified, all existing IPv6 services
                 are de-configured.

                 DHCP and BOOTP require no additional arguments. The IP
                 address, subnet mask, router, and DNS information are
                 retrieved automatically.

                 Both MANUAL and INFORM require the specification of an IP
                 address _i_p_-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s and a subnet mask _s_u_b_n_e_t_-_m_a_s_k.

                 The INFORM service configures the IP address statically like
                 MANUAL, but then broadcasts DHCP INFORM packets to retrieve
                 DHCP option information. If the DHCP server responds and sup-
                 plies a subnet mask, that subnet mask is used instead of the
                 specified _s_u_b_n_e_t_-_m_a_s_k.

                 AUTOMATIC-V6 requires no additional arguments.  The IPv6
                 address, prefix length and router are retrieved automati-
                 cally.

                 MANUAL-V6 requires the specification of the IPv6 address
                 _i_p_v_6_-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s and a prefix length _p_r_e_f_i_x_-_l_e_n_g_t_h.

                 6TO4 only works on Six To Four (IFT_STF) interfaces e.g.
                 stf0.  If it is specified on a non-IFT_STF interface, it has
                 the same effect as specifying NONE-V6.

                 The sseett command requires root privileges.

                 NNoottee:: The sseett command is very useful for debugging, but it
                 can't be used to configure a persistent service.  The tempo-
                 rary services that are created only remain until the next
                 network configuration change occurs. See scselect(8).

     sseettvveerrbboossee _l_e_v_e_l
                 Enables or disables verbose mode logging in the IPConfigura-
                 tion agent. Specify a _l_e_v_e_l value of 00 to disable verbose
                 logging, the default.  Specify a value of 11 to enable verbose
                 logging. This setting is persistent across boots of the oper-
                 ating system.

                 When enabled, verbose log files are generated in the direc-
